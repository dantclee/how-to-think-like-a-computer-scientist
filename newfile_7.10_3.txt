  31              With topsy-turvy magic,
  32            Sent ALICE wondering through a part
  33              Half-comic and half-tragic._
  34 
  35           _Enchanting ALICE! Black-and-white
  36              Has made your deeds perennial;
  37            And naught save "Chaos and old Night"
  38              Can part you now from TENNIEL;_
  39 
  40           _But still you are a Type, and based
  41              In Truth, like LEAR and HAMLET;

  43              In cloth-of-gold or camlet._
  44 
  45           _Here comes afresh Costumier, then;
  46              That Taste may gain a wrinkle
  47            From him who drew with such deft pen
  48              The rags of RIP VAN WINKLE!_

  54           All in the golden afternoon
  55             Full leisurely we glide;
  56           For both our oars, with little skill,
  57             By little arms are plied,
  58           While little hands make vain pretence
  59             Our wanderings to guide.
  60 
  61           Ah, cruel Three! In such an hour,
  62             Beneath such dreamy weather,
  63           To beg a tale of breath too weak
  64             To stir the tiniest feather!
  65           Yet what can one poor voice avail
  66             Against three tongues together?
  67 
  68           Imperious Prima flashes forth
  69             Her edict "to begin it"--
  70           In gentler tone Secunda hopes
  71             "There will be nonsense in it!"--
  72           While Tertia interrupts the tale
  73             Not _more_ than once a minute.
  74 
  75           Anon, to sudden silence won,
  76             In fancy they pursue
  77           The dream-child moving through a land
  78             Of wonders wild and new,
  79           In friendly chat with bird or beast--
  80             And half believe it true.
  81 
  82           And ever, as the story drained
  83             The wells of fancy dry.
  84           And faintly strove that weary one
  85             To put the subject by,
  86           "The rest next time--" "It _is_ next time!"
  87             The happy voices cry.
  88 
  89           Thus grew the tale of Wonderland:
  90             Thus slowly, one by one,
  91           Its quaint events were hammered out--
  92             And now the tale is done,
  93           And home we steer, a merry crew,
  94             Beneath the setting sun.
  95 
  96           Alice! a childish story take,
  97             And with a gentle hand
  98           Lay it where Childhood's dreams are twined
  99             In Memory's mystic band,
 100           Like pilgrim's wither'd wreath of flowers
 101             Pluck'd in a far-off land.

 182 CHAPTER I
 183 
 184 
 185 [Sidenote: _Down the Rabbit-Hole_]
 186 
 187 ALICE was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her
 188 sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had
 189 peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or
 190 conversations in it, "and what is the use of a book," thought Alice,
 191 "without pictures or conversations?"
 192 
 193 So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the
 194 hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid) whether the pleasure of
 195 making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
 196 picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
 197 close by her.
 198 
 199 There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it
 200 so _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, "Oh
 201 dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!" (when she thought it over
 202 afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this,
 203 but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit
 204 actually _took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it,
 205 and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across
 206 her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a
 207 waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with
 208 curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and was just in time to
 209 see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
 210 
 211 In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how
 212 in the world she was to get out again.
 213 
 214 The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then
 215 dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think
 216 about stopping herself before she found herself falling down what seemed
 217 to be a very deep well.
 218 
 219 [Illustration]
 220 
 221 Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had
 222 plenty of time as she went down to look about her, and to wonder what
 223 was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out
 224 what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she
 225 looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were filled with
 226 cupboards and book-shelves: here and there she saw maps and pictures
 227 hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she
 228 passed; it was labelled "ORANGE MARMALADE," but to her disappointment it
 229 was empty; she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing
 230 somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as
 231 she fell past it.
 232 
 233 "Well!" thought Alice to herself. "After such a fall as this, I shall
 234 think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me at
 235 home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the top
 236 of the house!" (Which was very likely true.)
 237 
 238 Down, down, down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end? "I wonder how
 239 many miles I've fallen by this time?" she said aloud. "I must be getting
 240 somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four
 241 thousand miles down. I think--" (for, you see, Alice had learnt several
 242 things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this
 243 was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as
 244 there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it
 245 over) "--yes, that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what
 246 Latitude or Longitude I've got to?" (Alice had no idea what Latitude
 247 was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to
 248 say.)
 249 
 250 Presently she began again. "I wonder if I shall fall right _through_ the
 251 earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk with
 252 their heads downwards! The Antipathies, I think--" (she was rather glad
 253 there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all the
 254 right word) "--but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country
 255 is, you know. Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?" (and she
 256 tried to curtsey as she spoke--fancy _curtseying_ as you're falling
 257 through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) "And what an
 258 ignorant little girl she'll think me! No, it'll never do to ask: perhaps
 259 I shall see it written up somewhere."
 260 
 261 Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began
 262 talking again. "Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!"
 263 (Dinah was the cat.) "I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at
 264 tea-time. Dinah, my dear, I wish you were down here with me! There are
 265 no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's
 266 very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?" And here
 267 Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a
 268 dreamy sort of way, "Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?" and sometimes,
 269 "Do bats eat cats?" for, you see, as she couldn't answer either
 270 question, it didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt that she
 271 was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in
 272 hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, "Now, Dinah, tell me
 273 the truth: did you ever eat a bat?" when suddenly, thump! thump! down
 274 she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.
 275 
 276 Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:
 277 she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long
 278 passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it.
 279 There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and
 280 was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, "Oh my ears and
 281 whiskers, how late it's getting!" She was close behind it when she
 282 turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found
 283 herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging
 284 from the roof.
 285 
 286 There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when
 287 Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every
 288 door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to
 289 get out again.
 290 
 291 Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid
 292 glass; there was nothing on it but a tiny golden key, and Alice's first
 293 idea was that this might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but,
 294 alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at
 295 any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second time
 296 round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and
 297 behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the
 298 little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!
 299 
 300 Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not
 301 much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage
 302 into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of
 303 that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and
 304 those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the
 305 doorway; "and even if my head would go through," thought poor Alice, "it
 306 would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could
 307 shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin."
 308 For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that
 309 Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really
 310 impossible.
 311 
 312 There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went
 313 back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at
 314 any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this
 315 time she found a little bottle on it ("which certainly was not here
 316 before," said Alice,) and tied round the neck of the bottle was a paper
 317 label, with the words "DRINK ME" beautifully printed on it in large
 318 letters.
 319 
 320 It was all very well to say "Drink me," but the wise little Alice was
 321 not going to do _that_ in a hurry. "No, I'll look first," she said, "and
 322 see whether it's marked '_poison_' or not;" for she had read several
 323 nice little stories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by
 324 wild beasts, and other unpleasant things, all because they _would_ not
 325 remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a
 326 red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that, if you
 327 cut your finger _very_ deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she
 328 had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked
 329 "poison," it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.
 330 
 331 However, this bottle was _not_ marked "poison," so Alice ventured to
 332 taste it, and finding it very nice (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed
 333 flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pineapple, roast turkey, coffee, and
 334 hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.
 335 
 336        *       *       *       *       *
 337 
 338 "What a curious feeling!" said Alice. "I must be shutting up like a
 339 telescope."
 340 
 341 And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face
 342 brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going
 343 through that little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she
 344 waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:
 345 she felt a little nervous about this: "for it might end, you know," said
 346 Alice to herself, "in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder
 347 what I should be like then?" And she tried to fancy what the flame of a
 348 candle looks like after the candle is blown out, for she could not
 349 remember ever having seen such a thing.
 350 
 351 After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going
 352 into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the
 353 door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she
 354 went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach
 355 it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her
 356 best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;
 357 and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing
 358 sat down and cried.
 359 
 360 "Come, there's no use in crying like that!" said Alice to herself,
 361 rather sharply. "I advise you to leave off this minute!" She generally
 362 gave herself very good advice (though she very seldom followed it), and
 363 sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her
 364 eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having
 365 cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,
 366 for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.
 367 "But it's no use now," thought poor Alice, "to pretend to be two people!
 368 Why there's hardly enough of me left to make _one_ respectable person!"
 369 
 370 Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:
 371 she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words
 372 "EAT ME" were beautifully marked in currants. "Well, I'll eat it," said
 373 Alice, "and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it
 374 makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I'll
 375 get into the garden, and I don't care which happens!"
 376 
 377 She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, "Which way? Which
 378 way?" holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was
 379 growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same
 380 size; to be sure, this is what generally happens when one eats cake,
 381 but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but
 382 out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid
 383 for life to go on in the common way.
 384 
 385 So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.
 386 
 387        *       *       *       *       *

 392 CHAPTER II
 393 
 394 
 395 [Sidenote: _Pool of Tears_]
 396 
 397 "CURIOUSER and curiouser!" cried Alice (she was so much
 398 surprised, that for a moment she quite forgot how to speak good
 399 English); "now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that ever was!
 400 Good-bye, feet!" (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to
 401 be almost out of sight, they were getting so far off). "Oh, my poor
 402 little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you
 403 now, dears? I'm sure _I_ sha'n't be able! I shall be a great deal too
 404 far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you
 405 can--but I must be kind to them," thought Alice, "or perhaps they won't
 406 walk the way I want to go! Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of
 407 boots every Christmas."
 408 
 409 And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. "They must
 410 go by the carrier," she thought; "and how funny it'll seem, sending
 411 presents to one's own feet! And how odd the directions will look!
 412 
 413           Alice's Right Foot, Esq.
 414               Hearthrug,
 415                   near the Fender,
 416                       (with Alice's love).
 417 
 418 Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!"
 419 
 420 Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was
 421 now rather more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little
 422 golden key and hurried off to the garden door.
 423 
 424 Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to
 425 look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more
 426 hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.
 427 
 428 "You ought to be ashamed of yourself," said Alice, "a great girl like
 429 you" (she might well say this), "to go on crying in this way! Stop this
 430 moment, I tell you!" But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of
 431 tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches
 432 deep and reaching half down the hall.
 433 
 434 [Illustration: CURIOUSER AND CURIOUSER]
 435 
 436 After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and
 437 she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White
 438 Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in
 439 one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great
 440 hurry, muttering to himself as he came, "Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess!
 441 Oh! won't she be savage if I've kept her waiting!" Alice felt so
 442 desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the
 443 Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, "If you please,
 444 sir----" The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and
 445 the fan, and scurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.
 446 
 447 Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she
 448 kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking! "Dear, dear! How
 449 queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.
 450 I wonder if I've been changed during the night? Let me think: _was_ I
 451 the same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember
 452 feeling a little different. But if I'm not the same, the next question
 453 is, who in the world am I? Ah, _that's_ the great puzzle!" And she began
 454 thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as
 455 herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.
 456 
 457 "I'm sure I'm not Ada," she said, "for her hair goes in such long
 458 ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm sure I can't
 459 be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a
 460 very little! Besides, _she's_ she, and _I'm_ I, and--oh dear, how
 461 puzzling it all is! I'll try if I know all the things I used to know.
 462 Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen,
 463 and four times seven is--oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that
 464 rate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try
 465 Geography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of
 466 Rome, and Rome--no, _that's_ all wrong, I'm certain! I must have been
 467 changed for Mabel! I'll try and say '_How doth the little----_'" and she
 468 crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to
 469 repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did
 470 not come the same as they used to do:--
 471 
 472           "How doth the little crocodile
 473              Improve his shining tail,
 474            And pour the waters of the Nile
 475              On every golden scale!
 476 
 477           "How cheerfully he seems to grin,
 478              How neatly spreads his claws,
 479            And welcomes little fishes in,
 480              With gently smiling jaws!"
 481 
 482 "I'm sure those are not the right words," said poor Alice, and her eyes
 483 filled with tears again as she went on. "I must be Mabel, after all, and
 484 I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to
 485 no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I've
 486 made up my mind about it; if I'm Mabel, I'll stay down here! It'll be no
 487 use their putting their heads down and saying, 'Come up again, dear!' I
 488 shall only look up and say, 'Who am I then? Tell me that first, and
 489 then, if I like being that person, I'll come up: if not, I'll stay down
 490 here till I'm somebody else'--but, oh dear!" cried Alice with a sudden
 491 burst of tears, "I do wish they _would_ put their heads down! I am so
 492 _very_ tired of being all alone here!"
 493 
 494 As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see
 495 that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little white kid gloves while
 496 she was talking. "How _can_ I have done that?" she thought. "I must be
 497 growing small again." She got up and went to the table to measure
 498 herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now
 499 about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found
 500 out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped
 501 it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.
 502 
 503 "That _was_ a narrow escape!" said Alice, a good deal frightened at the
 504 sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; "and
 505 now for the garden!" and she ran with all speed back to the little door:
 506 but alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was
 507 lying on the glass table as before, "and things are worse than ever,"
 508 thought the poor child, "for I never was so small as this before, never!
 509 And I declare it's too bad, that it is!"
 510 
 511 As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash!
 512 she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she had
 513 somehow fallen into the sea, "and in that case I can go back by
 514 railway," she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in
 515 her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go
 516 to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the
 517 sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row
 518 of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she soon
 519 made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she
 520 was nine feet high.
 521 
 522 "I wish I hadn't cried so much!" said Alice, as she swam about, trying
 523 to find her way out. "I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by
 524 being drowned in my own tears! That _will_ be a queer thing, to be sure!
 525 However, everything is queer to-day."
 526 
 527 Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way
 528 off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought
 529 it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small
 530 she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had
 531 slipped in like herself.
 532 
 533 "Would it be of any use now," thought Alice, "to speak to this mouse?
 534 Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very
 535 likely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in trying." So she
 536 began: "O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired
 537 of swimming about here, O Mouse!" (Alice thought this must be the right
 538 way of speaking to a mouse; she had never done such a thing before, but
 539 she remembered having seen in her brother's Latin Grammar, "A mouse--of
 540 a mouse--to a mouse--a mouse--O mouse!") The Mouse looked at her rather
 541 inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,
 542 but it said nothing.
 543 
 544 "Perhaps it doesn't understand English," thought Alice; "I daresay it's
 545 a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror." (For, with all
 546 her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago
 547 anything had happened.) So she began again: "Où est ma chatte?" which
 548 was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a
 549 sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright.
 550 "Oh, I beg your pardon!" cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt
 551 the poor animal's feelings. "I quite forgot you didn't like cats."
 552 
 553 "Not like cats!" cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. "Would
 554 _you_ like cats if you were me?"
 555 
 556 "Well, perhaps not," said Alice in a soothing tone: "don't be angry
 557 about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you'd
 558 take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear quiet
 559 thing," Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the
 560 pool, "and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and
 561 washing her face--and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she's
 562 such a capital one for catching mice----oh, I beg your pardon!" cried
 563 Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she
 564 felt certain it must be really offended. "We won't talk about her any
 565 more if you'd rather not."
 566 
 567 "We, indeed!" cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his
 568 tail. "As if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always _hated_
 569 cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear the name again!"
 570 
 571 [Illustration: _The Pool of Tears_]
 572 
 573 "I won't indeed!" said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of
 574 conversation. "Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?" The Mouse did not
 575 answer, so Alice went on eagerly: "There is such a nice little dog near
 576 our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you
 577 know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it'll fetch things
 578 when you throw them, and it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all
 579 sorts of things--I can't remember half of them--and it belongs to a
 580 farmer, you know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred
 581 pounds! He says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!" cried Alice in a
 582 sorrowful tone, "I'm afraid I've offended it again!" For the Mouse was
 583 swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a
 584 commotion in the pool as it went.
 585 
 586 So she called softly after it, "Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we
 587 won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't like them!"
 588 
 589 When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her:
 590 its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a
 591 low trembling voice, "Let us get to the shore, and then I'll tell you my
 592 history, and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs."
 593 
 594 It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the
 595 birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo,
 596 a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the
 597 way, and the whole party swam to the shore.
 598 
 599 
 600 
 601 
 602 CHAPTER III
 603 
 604 
 605 [Sidenote: _A Caucus-race and a Long Tale_]
 606 
 607 THEY were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on
 608 the bank--the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur
 609 clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.
 610 
 611 The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a
 612 consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural
 613 to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had
 614 known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the
 615 Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, "I am older than
 616 you, and must know better;" and this Alice would not allow without
 617 knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its
 618 age, there was no more to be said.
 619 
 620 At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,
 621 called out "Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! _I'll_ soon make you
 622 dry enough!" They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse
 623 in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt
 624 sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.
 625 
 626 "Ahem!" said the Mouse with an important air. "Are you all ready? This
 627 is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! 'William
 628 the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted
 629 to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much
 630 accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of
 631 Mercia and Northumbria--'"
 632 
 633 "Ugh!" said the Lory, with a shiver.
 634 
 635 "I beg your pardon!" said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely. "Did
 636 you speak?"
 637 
 638 "Not I!" said the Lory hastily.
 639 
 640 "I thought you did," said the Mouse, "--I proceed. 'Edwin and Morcar,
 641 the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even
 642 Stigand, the patriotic Archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable--'"
 643 
 644 "Found _what_?" said the Duck.
 645 
 646 "Found _it_," the Mouse replied rather crossly: "of course you know what
 647 'it' means."
 648 
 649 "I know what 'it' means well enough, when _I_ find a thing," said the
 650 Duck; "it's generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the
 651 archbishop find?"
 652 
 653 The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, "'--found
 654 it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the
 655 crown. William's conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence of his
 656 Normans--' How are you getting on now, my dear?" it continued, turning
 657 to Alice as it spoke.
 658 
 659 "As wet as ever," said Alice in a melancholy tone; "doesn't seem to dry
 660 me at all."
 661 
 662 "In that case," said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, "I move that
 663 the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic
 664 remedies----"
 665 
 666 "Speak English!" said the Eaglet. "I don't know the meaning of half
 667 those long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do either!" And
 668 the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds
 669 tittered audibly.
 670 
 671 "What I was going to say," said the Dodo in an offended tone, "was that
 672 the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race."
 673 
 674 "What _is_ a Caucus-race?" said Alice; not that she much wanted to know,
 675 but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that _somebody_ ought to speak,
 676 and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.
 677 
 678 "Why," said the Dodo, "the best way to explain it is to do it." (And, as
 679 you might like to try the thing yourself some winter day, I will tell
 680 you how the Dodo managed it.)
 681 
 682 First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, ("the exact
 683 shape doesn't matter," it said,) and then all the party were placed
 684 along the course, here and there. There was no "One, two, three, and
 685 away," but they began running when they liked, and left off when they
 686 liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,
 687 when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again,
 688 the Dodo suddenly called "The race is over!" and they all crowded round
 689 it, panting, and asking "But who has won?"
 690 
 691 This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought,
 692 and it stood for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead
 693 (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures of
 694 him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo said
 695 "_Everybody_ has won, and _all_ must have prizes."
 696 
 697 "But who is to give the prizes?" quite a chorus of voices asked.
 698 
 699 "Why, _she_, of course," said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one
 700 finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a
 701 confused way, "Prizes! Prizes!"
 702 
 703 Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her
 704 pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits (luckily the salt water had not
 705 got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly one
 706 apiece all round.
 707 
 708           _They all crowded round it panting and asking,
 709           "But who has won?"_
 710 
 711 [Illustration]
 712 
 713 "But she must have a prize herself, you know," said the Mouse.
 714 
 715 "Of course," the Dodo replied very gravely.
 716 
 717 "What else have you got in your pocket?" it went on, turning to Alice.
 718 
 719 "Only a thimble," said Alice sadly.
 720 
 721 "Hand it over here," said the Dodo.
 722 
 723 Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly
 724 presented the thimble, saying "We beg your acceptance of this elegant
 725 thimble;" and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered.
 726 
 727 Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave
 728 that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything
 729 to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she
 730 could.
 731 
 732 The next thing was to eat the comfits; this caused some noise and
 733 confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste
 734 theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.
 735 However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and
 736 begged the Mouse to tell them something more.
 737 
 738 "You promised to tell me your history, you know," said Alice, "and why
 739 it is you hate--C and D," she added in a whisper, half afraid that it
 740 would be offended again.
 741 
 742 [Illustration]
 743 
 744 "Mine is a long and sad tale!" said the Mouse, turning to Alice and
 745 sighing.
 746 
 747 "It _is_ a long tail, certainly," said Alice, looking down with wonder
 748 at the Mouse's tail; "but why do you call it sad?" And she kept on
 749 puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the
 750 tale was something like this:--
 751 
 752           "Fury said to
 753               a mouse, That
 754                   he met in the
 755                       house, 'Let
 756                         us both go
 757                           to law: _I_
 758                              will prose-
 759                               cute _you_.--
 760                              Come, I'll
 761                            take no de-
 762                          nial: We
 763                      must have
 764                  the trial;
 765               For really
 766              this morn-
 767            ing I've
 768           nothing
 769            to do.'
 770             Said the
 771              mouse to
 772               the cur,
 773                'Such a
 774                 trial, dear
 775                   sir, With
 776                    no jury
 777                      or judge,

 779                         be wast-
 780                        ing our

 782                     'I'll be
 783                    judge,
 784                  I'll be
 785                jury,'
 786              said
 787            cun-
 788           ning
 789            old
 790             Fury:

 793                  the
 794                   whole
 795                    cause,
 796                        and

 799               you to
 800             death.'
 801 
 802 "You are not attending!" said the Mouse to Alice severely. "What are you
 803 thinking of?"
 804 
 805 "I beg your pardon," said Alice very humbly: "you had got to the fifth
 806 bend, I think?"
 807 
 808 "I had _not_!" cried the Mouse, angrily.
 809 
 810 "A knot!" said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking
 811 anxiously about her. "Oh, do let me help to undo it!"
 812 
 813 "I shall do nothing of the sort," said the Mouse, getting up and walking
 814 away. "You insult me by talking such nonsense!"
 815 
 816 "I didn't mean it!" pleaded poor Alice. "But you're so easily offended,
 817 you know!"
 818 
 819 The Mouse only growled in reply.
 820 
 821 "Please come back and finish your story!" Alice called after it. And the
 822 others all joined in chorus, "Yes, please do!" but the Mouse only shook
 823 its head impatiently and walked a little quicker.
 824 
 825 "What a pity it wouldn't stay!" sighed the Lory, as soon as it was quite
 826 out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her
 827 daughter, "Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose
 828 _your_ temper!" "Hold your tongue, Ma!" said the young Crab, a little
 829 snappishly. "You're enough to try the patience of an oyster!"
 830 
 831 "I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!" said Alice aloud, addressing
 832 nobody in particular. "She'd soon fetch it back!"
 833 
 834 "And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?" said the
 835 Lory.
 836 
 837 Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet:
 838 "Dinah's our cat. And she's such a capital one for catching mice, you
 839 ca'n't think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why,
 840 she'll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!"
 841 
 842 This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the
 843 birds hurried off at once; one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very
 844 carefully, remarking "I really must be getting home; the night-air
 845 doesn't suit my throat!" and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to
 846 its children "Come away, my dears! It's high time you were all in bed!"
 847 On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.
 848 
 849 "I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!" she said to herself in a melancholy
 850 tone. "Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm sure she's the best
 851 cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you
 852 any more!" And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very
 853 lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a
 854 little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up
 855 eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming
 856 back to finish his story.

 861 CHAPTER IV
 862 
 863 
 864 [Sidenote: _The Rabbit sends in a Little Bill_]
 865 
 866 IT was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and
 867 looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she
 868 heard it muttering to itself, "The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear
 869 paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She'll get me executed, as sure as ferrets
 870 are ferrets! Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?" Alice guessed
 871 in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid
 872 gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but
 873 they were nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since
 874 her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the
 875 little door, had vanished completely.
 876 
 877 Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and
 878 called out to her in an angry tone, "Why, Mary Ann, what _are_ you
 879 doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and
 880 a fan! Quick, now!" And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at
 881 once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the
 882 mistake it had made.
 883 
 884 "He took me for his housemaid," she said to herself as she ran. "How
 885 surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am! But I'd better take him
 886 his fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them." As she said this, she
 887 came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass
 888 plate with the name "W. RABBIT" engraved upon it. She went in without
 889 knocking, and hurried up stairs, in great fear lest she should meet the
 890 real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the
 891 fan and gloves.
 892 
 893 [Illustration: "_Why, Mary Ann, what are you doing out here?_"]
 894 
 895 "How queer it seems," Alice said to herself, "to be going messages for a
 896 rabbit! I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on messages next!" And she
 897 began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: "'Miss Alice! Come
 898 here directly, and get ready for your walk!' 'Coming in a minute, nurse!
 899 But I've got to watch this mouse-hole till Dinah comes back, and see
 900 that the mouse doesn't get out.' Only I don't think," Alice went on,
 901 "that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people
 902 about like that!"
 903 
 904 By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table
 905 in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs
 906 of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves,
 907 and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little
 908 bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label this time
 909 with the words "DRINK ME," but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it
 910 to her lips. "I know _something_ interesting is sure to happen," she
 911 said to herself, "whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see
 912 what this bottle does. I do hope it will make me grow large again, for
 913 really I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!"
 914 
 915 It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had
 916 drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,
 917 and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put
 918 down the bottle, saying to herself "That's quite enough--I hope I
 919 sha'n't grow any more--As it is, I can't get out at the door--I do wish
 920 I hadn't drunk quite so much!"
 921 
 922 Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,
 923 and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there
 924 was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with
 925 one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.
 926 Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out
 927 of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself "Now I
 928 can do no more, whatever happens. What _will_ become of me?"
 929 
 930 Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,
 931 and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there
 932 seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room
 933 again, no wonder she felt unhappy.
 934 
 935 "It was much pleasanter at home," thought poor Alice, "when one wasn't
 936 always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and
 937 rabbits. I almost wish I hadn't gone down that rabbit-hole--and
 938 yet--and yet--it's rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do
 939 wonder what _can_ have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales,
 940 I fancied that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the
 941 middle of one! There ought to be a book written about me, that there
 942 ought! And when I grow up, I'll write one--but I'm grown up now," she
 943 added in a sorrowful tone; "at least there's no room to grow up any more
 944 _here_."
 945 
 946 "But then," thought Alice, "shall I _never_ get any older than I am now?
 947 That'll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman--but
 948 then--always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn't like _that_!"
 949 
 950 "Oh, you foolish Alice!" she answered herself. "How can you learn
 951 lessons in here? Why, there's hardly room for _you_, and no room at all
 952 for any lesson-books!"
 953 
 954 And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and making
 955 quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes she heard
 956 a voice outside, and stopped to listen.
 957 
 958 "Mary Ann! Mary Ann!" said the voice. "Fetch me my gloves this moment!"
 959 Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was
 960 the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the
 961 house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large
 962 as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.
 963 
 964 Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as
 965 the door opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed hard against it,
 966 that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself "Then I'll
 967 go round and get in at the window."
 968 
 969 "_That_ you won't" thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied
 970 she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her
 971 hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,
 972 but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,
 973 from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a
 974 cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.
 975 
 976 Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--"Pat! Pat! Where are you?" And
 977 then a voice she had never heard before, "Sure then I'm here! Digging
 978 for apples, yer honour!"
 979 
 980 "Digging for apples, indeed!" said the Rabbit angrily. "Here! Come and
 981 help me out of _this_!" (Sounds of more broken glass.)
 982 
 983 "Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?"
 984 
 985 "Sure, it's an arm, yer honour." (He pronounced it "arrum.")
 986 
 987 "An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole
 988 window!"
 989 
 990 "Sure, it does, yer honour? but it's an arm for all that."
 991 
 992 "Well, it's got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!"
 993 
 994 There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers
 995 now and then; such as, "Sure, I don't like it, yer honour, at all, at
 996 all!" "Do as I tell you, you coward!" and at last she spread out her
 997 hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were
 998 _two_ little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. "What a number of
 999 cucumber-frames there must be!" thought Alice. "I wonder what they'll do
1000 next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they _could_!
1001 I'm sure _I_ don't want to stay in here any longer!"
1002 
1003 She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a
1004 rumbling of little cart-wheels, and the sound of a good many voices all
1005 talking together: she made out the words: "Where's the other
1006 ladder?--Why I hadn't to bring but one; Bill's got the other--Bill!
1007 Fetch it here, lad!--Here, put 'em up at this corner--No, tie 'em
1008 together first--they don't reach half high enough yet--Oh! they'll do
1009 well enough; don't be particular--Here, Bill! catch hold of this
1010 rope--Will the roof bear?--Mind that loose slate--Oh, it's coming down!
1011 Heads below!" (a loud crash)--"Now, who did that?--It was Bill, I
1012 fancy--Who's to go down the chimney?--Nay, _I_ sha'n't! _You_ do
1013 it!--_That_ I won't, then! Bill's to go down--Here, Bill! the master
1014 says you've to go down the chimney!"
1015 
1016 "Oh! So Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he?" said Alice to
1017 herself. "Why, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn't be in
1018 Bill's place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but
1019 I _think_ I can kick a little!"
1020 
1021 She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till
1022 she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess of what sort it was)
1023 scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,
1024 saying to herself "This is Bill," she gave one sharp kick, and waited to
1025 see what would happen next.
1026 
1027 The first thing she heard was a general chorus of "There goes Bill!"
1028 then the Rabbit's voice alone--"Catch him, you by the hedge!" then
1029 silence, and then another confusion of voices--"Hold up his head--Brandy
1030 now--Don't choke him--How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell
1031 us all about it!"
1032 
1033 At last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, ("That's Bill," thought
1034 Alice,) "Well, I hardly know--No more, thank ye; I'm better now--but I'm
1035 a deal too flustered to tell you--all I know is, something comes at me
1036 like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!"
1037 
1038 "So you did, old fellow!" said the others.
1039 
1040 "We must burn the house down!" said the Rabbit's voice. And Alice
1041 called out as loud as she could, "If you do, I'll set Dinah at you!"
1042 
1043 There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself "I
1044 wonder what they _will_ do next! If they had any sense, they'd take the
1045 roof off." After a minute or two they began moving about again, and
1046 Alice heard the Rabbit say "A barrowful will do, to begin with."
1047 
1048 "A barrowful of _what_?" thought Alice. But she had not long to doubt,
1049 for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the
1050 window, and some of them hit her in the face. "I'll put a stop to this,"
1051 she said to herself, and shouted out "You'd better not do that again!"
1052 which produced another dead silence.
1053 
1054 Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into
1055 little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her
1056 head. "If I eat one of these cakes," she thought, "it's sure to make
1057 _some_ change in my size; and, as it can't possibly make me larger, it
1058 must make me smaller, I suppose."
1059 
1060 So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she
1061 began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through
1062 the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little
1063 animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in
1064 the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it
1065 something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she
1066 appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself
1067 safe in a thick wood.
1068 
1069 "The first thing I've got to do," said Alice to herself, as she wandered
1070 about in the wood, "is to grow to my right size again; and the second
1071 thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be
1072 the best plan."
1073 
1074 It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply
1075 arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea
1076 how to set about it; and, while she was peering about anxiously among
1077 the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a
1078 great hurry.
1079 
1080 An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and
1081 feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. "Poor little
1082 thing!" said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to
1083 it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it
1084 might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in
1085 spite of all her coaxing.
1086 
1087 Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and
1088 held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off
1089 all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,
1090 and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,
1091 to keep herself from being run over; and, the moment she appeared on the
1092 other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head
1093 over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was
1094 very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every
1095 moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then
1096 the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a little
1097 way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely all the
1098 while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its
1099 tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.
1100 
1101 This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she
1102 set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and
1103 till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the distance.
1104 
1105 "And yet what a dear little puppy it was!" said Alice, as she leant
1106 against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the
1107 leaves. "I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if--if I'd
1108 only been the right size to do it! Oh, dear! I'd nearly forgotten that
1109 I've got to grow up again! Let me see--how _is_ it to be managed? I
1110 suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great
1111 question is, what?"
1112 
1113 The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at
1114 the flowers and the blades of grass, but she could not see anything that
1115 looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.
1116 There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as
1117 herself; and, when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and
1118 behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what
1119 was on the top of it.
1120 
1121 She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the
1122 mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue
1123 caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly
1124 smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of
1125 anything else.
1126 
1127 
1128 
1129 
1130 CHAPTER V
1131 
1132 
1133 [Sidenote: _Advice from a Caterpillar_]
1134 
1135 THE Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some
1136 time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its
1137 mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.
1138 
1139 "Who are _you_?" said the Caterpillar.
1140 
1141 This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,
1142 rather shyly, "I hardly know, sir, just at present--at least I know who
1143 I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed
1144 several times since then."
1145 
1146 "What do you mean by that?" said the Caterpillar sternly. "Explain
1147 yourself!"
1148 
1149 "I can't explain _myself_, I'm afraid, sir," said Alice, "because I'm
1150 not myself, you see."
1151 
1152 "I don't see," said the Caterpillar.
1153 
1154 "I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly," Alice replied very politely,
1155 "for I can't understand it myself to begin with; and being so many
1156 different sizes in a day is very confusing."
1157 
1158 "It isn't," said the Caterpillar.
1159 
1160 "Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet," said Alice, "but when you
1161 have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you know--and then
1162 after that into a butterfly, I should think you'll feel it a little
1163 queer, won't you?"
1164 
1165 "Not a bit," said the Caterpillar.
1166 
1167 "Well, perhaps your feelings may be different," said Alice; "all I know
1168 is, it would feel very queer to _me_."
1169 
1170 "You!" said the Caterpillar contemptuously. "Who are _you_?"
1171 
1172 Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.
1173 Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's making such _very_
1174 short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, "I think
1175 you ought to tell me who _you_ are, first."
1176 
1177 "Why?" said the Caterpillar.
1178 
1179 [Illustration: _Advice from a Caterpillar_]
1180 
1181 Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any
1182 good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_
1183 unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.
1184 
1185 "Come back!" the Caterpillar called after her. "I've something important
1186 to say!"
1187 
1188 This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.
1189 
1190 "Keep your temper," said the Caterpillar.
1191 
1192 "Is that all?" said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she
1193 could.
1194 
1195 "No," said the Caterpillar.
1196 
1197 Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and
1198 perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For some
1199 minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its
1200 arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, "So you think
1201 you're changed, do you?"
1202 
1203 "I'm afraid I am, sir," said Alice; "I can't remember things as I
1204 used--and I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together!"
1205 
1206 "Can't remember _what_ things?" said the Caterpillar.
1207 
1208 "Well, I've tried to say '_How doth the little busy bee_,' but it all
1209 came different!" Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.
1210 
1211 "Repeat '_You are old, Father William_,'" said the Caterpillar.
1212 
1213 Alice folded her hands, and began:--
1214 
1215           "You are old, Father William," the young man said,
1216             "And your hair has become very white;
1217           And yet you incessantly stand on your head--
1218             Do you think, at your age, it is right?"
1219 
1220           "In my youth," Father William replied to his son,
1221             "I feared it might injure the brain;
1222           But, now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,
1223             Why, I do it again and again."
1224 
1225           "You are old," said the youth, "as I mentioned before,
1226             And have grown most uncommonly fat;
1227           Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door--
1228             Pray, what is the reason of that?"
1229 
1230           "In my youth," said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,
1231             "I kept all my limbs very supple
1232           By the use of this ointment--one shilling the box--
1233             Allow me to sell you a couple?"
1234 
1235           "You are old," said the youth, "and your jaws are too weak
1236             For anything tougher than suet;
1237           Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak--
1238             Pray, how did you manage to do it?"
1239 
1240           "In my youth," said his father, "I took to the law
1241             And argued each case with my wife;
1242           And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,
1243             Has lasted the rest of my life."
1244 
1245           "You are old," said the youth, "one would hardly suppose
1246             That your eye was as steady as ever;
1247           Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose--
1248             What made you so awfully clever?"
1249 
1250           "I have answered three questions, and that is enough,"
1251             Said his father; "don't give yourself airs!
1252           Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
1253             Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs!"
1254 
1255 "That is not said right," said the Caterpillar.
1256 
1257 "Not _quite_ right, I'm afraid," said Alice, timidly; "some of the
1258 words have got altered."
1259 
1260 "It is wrong from beginning to end," said the Caterpillar, decidedly,
1261 and there was silence for some minutes.
1262 
1263 The Caterpillar was the first to speak.
1264 
1265 "What size do you want to be?" it asked.
1266 
1267 "Oh, I'm not particular as to size," Alice hastily replied; "only one
1268 doesn't like changing so often, you know."
1269 
1270 "I _don't_ know," said the Caterpillar.
1271 
1272 Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in all her
1273 life before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.
1274 
1275 "Are you content now?" said the Caterpillar.
1276 
1277 "Well, I should like to be a _little_ larger, sir, if you wouldn't
1278 mind," said Alice: "three inches is such a wretched height to be."
1279 
1280 "It is a very good height indeed!" said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing
1281 itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).
1282 
1283 "But I'm not used to it!" pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she
1284 thought to herself, "I wish the creatures wouldn't be so easily
1285 offended!"
1286 
1287 "You'll get used to it in time," said the Caterpillar; and it put its
1288 hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.
1289 
1290 This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a
1291 minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and
1292 yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the
1293 mushroom, and crawled away into the grass, merely remarking as it went,
1294 "One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you
1295 grow shorter."
1296 
1297 "One side of _what_? The other side of _what_?" thought Alice to
1298 herself.
1299 
1300 "Of the mushroom," said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it
1301 aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.
1302 
1303 Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying
1304 to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly
1305 round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at last she
1306 stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit
1307 of the edge with each hand.
1308 
1309 "And now which is which?" she said to herself, and nibbled a little of
1310 the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a violent
1311 blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!
1312 
1313 [Illustration]
1314 
1315 She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt
1316 that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she
1317 set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed
1318 so closely against her foot that there was hardly room to open her
1319 mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the
1320 left-hand bit.
1321 
1322        *       *       *       *       *
1323 
1324 "Come, my head's free at last!" said Alice in a tone of delight, which
1325 changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders
1326 were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was
1327 an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a
1328 sea of green leaves that lay far below her.
1329 
1330 "What _can_ all that green stuff be?" said Alice. "And where have my
1331 shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I ca'n't see you?"
1332 She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,
1333 except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.
1334 
1335 As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, she
1336 tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that her
1337 neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She had
1338 just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going
1339 to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops
1340 of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made
1341 her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and
1342 was beating her violently with its wings.
1343 
1344 "Serpent!" screamed the Pigeon.
1345 
1346 "I'm _not_ a serpent!" said Alice indignantly. "Let me alone!"
1347 
1348 "Serpent, I say again!" repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone,
1349 and added with a kind of a sob, "I've tried every way, and nothing seems
1350 to suit them!"
1351 
1352 "I haven't the least idea what you're talking about," said Alice.
1353 
1354 "I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've tried
1355 hedges," the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; "but those
1356 serpents! There's no pleasing them!"
1357 
1358 Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in
1359 saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.
1360 
1361 "As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs," said the Pigeon;
1362 "but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I
1363 haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks!"
1364 
1365 "I'm very sorry you've been annoyed," said Alice, who was beginning to
1366 see its meaning.
1367 
1368 [Illustration]
1369 
1370 "And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood," continued the
1371 Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, "and just as I was thinking I
1372 should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from
1373 the sky! Ugh, Serpent!"
1374 
1375 "But I'm _not_ a serpent, I tell you!" said Alice. "I'm a---- I'm a
1376 ----"
1377 
1378 "Well! _What_ are you?" said the Pigeon. "I can see you're trying to
1379 invent something!"
1380 
1381 "I--I'm a little girl," said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered
1382 the number of changes she had gone through that day.
1383 
1384 "A likely story indeed!" said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest
1385 contempt. "I've seen a good many little girls in my time, but never
1386 _one_ with such a neck as that! No, no! You're a serpent; and there's no
1387 use denying it. I suppose you'll be telling me next that you never
1388 tasted an egg!"
1389 
1390 "I _have_ tasted eggs, certainly," said Alice, who was a very truthful
1391 child; "but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you
1392 know."
1393 
1394 "I don't believe it," said the Pigeon; "but if they do, why then
1395 they're a kind of serpent, that's all I can say."
1396 
1397 This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a
1398 minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, "You're
1399 looking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough; and what does it matter to
1400 me whether you're a little girl or a serpent?"
1401 
1402 "It matters a good deal to _me_," said Alice hastily; "but I'm not
1403 looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't want _yours_:
1404 I don't like them raw."
1405 
1406 "Well, be off, then!" said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled
1407 down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well as
1408 she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and
1409 every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while she
1410 remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and
1411 she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the
1412 other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had
1413 succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.
1414 
1415 It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it
1416 felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,
1417 and began talking to herself, as usual. "Come, there's half my plan done
1418 now! How puzzling all these changes are! I'm never sure what I'm going
1419 to be, from one minute to another! However, I've got back to my right
1420 size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how _is_
1421 that to be done, I wonder?" As she said this, she came suddenly upon an
1422 open place, with a little house in it about four feet high. "Whoever
1423 lives there," thought Alice, "it'll never do to come upon them _this_
1424 size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!" So she began
1425 nibbling at the right-hand bit again, and did not venture to go near the
1426 house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.
1427 
1428 
1429 
1430 
1431 CHAPTER VI
1432 
1433 
1434 [Sidenote: _Pig and Pepper_]
1435 
1436 FOR a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and
1437 wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came
1438 running out of the wood--(she considered him to be a footman because he
1439 was in livery: otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have
1440 called him a fish)--and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It
1441 was opened by another footman in livery, with a round face and large
1442 eyes like a frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair
1443 that curled all over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it
1444 was all about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.
1445 
1446 The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,
1447 nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,
1448 saying, in a solemn tone, "For the Duchess. An invitation from the
1449 Queen to play croquet." The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn
1450 tone, only changing the order of the words a little, "From the Queen. An
1451 invitation for the Duchess to play croquet."
1452 
1453 Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.
1454 
1455 Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood
1456 for fear of their hearing her; and, when she next peeped out, the
1457 Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the
1458 door, staring stupidly up into the sky.
1459 
1460 Alice went timidly up to the door and knocked.
1461 
1462 "There's no use in knocking," said the Footman, "and that for two
1463 reasons. First, because I'm on the same side of the door as you are;
1464 secondly, because they're making such a noise inside, no one could
1465 possibly hear you." And certainly there was a most extraordinary noise
1466 going on within--a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then
1467 a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces.
1468 
1469 "Please, then," said Alice, "how am I to get in?"
1470 
1471 "There might be some sense in your knocking," the Footman went on
1472 without attending to her, "if we had the door between us. For instance,
1473 if you were _inside_, you might knock, and I could let you out, you
1474 know." He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and
1475 this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. "But perhaps he can't help it,"
1476 she said to herself: "his eyes are so _very_ nearly at the top of his
1477 head. But at any rate he might answer questions. How am I to get in?"
1478 she repeated aloud.
1479 
1480 "I shall sit here," the Footman remarked, "till to-morrow----"
1481 
1482 At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came
1483 skimming out, straight at the Footman's head: it just grazed his nose,
1484 and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.
1485 
1486 "----or next day, maybe," the Footman continued in the same tone,
1487 exactly as if nothing had happened.
1488 
1489 "How am I to get in?" asked Alice again in a louder tone.
1490 
1491 "_Are_ you to get in at all?" said the Footman. "That's the first
1492 question, you know."
1493 
1494 [Illustration]
1495 
1496 It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. "It's really
1497 dreadful," she muttered to herself, "the way all the creatures argue.
1498 It's enough to drive one crazy!"
1499 
1500 The Footman seemed to consider this a good opportunity for repeating his
1501 remark, with variations. "I shall sit here," he said, "on and off, for
1502 days and days."
1503 
1504 "But what am _I_ to do?" said Alice.
1505 
1506 "Anything you like," said the Footman, and began whistling.
1507 
1508 "Oh, there's no use in talking to him," said Alice desperately: "he's
1509 perfectly idiotic!" And she opened the door and went in.
1510 
1511 The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from
1512 one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in
1513 the middle, nursing a baby, the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring
1514 a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.
1515 
1516 "There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!" Alice said to herself,
1517 as well as she could for sneezing.
1518 
1519 There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed
1520 occasionally; and the baby was sneezing and howling alternately without
1521 a moment's pause. The only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze,
1522 were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and
1523 grinning from ear to ear.
1524 
1525 "Please would you tell me," said Alice a little timidly, for she was not
1526 quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, "why your
1527 cat grins like that?"
1528 
1529 "It's a Cheshire cat," said the Duchess, "and that's why. Pig!"
1530 
1531 She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite
1532 jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby,
1533 and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:
1534 
1535 "I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn't know
1536 that cats _could_ grin."
1537 
1538 "They all can," said the Duchess; "and most of 'em do."
1539 
1540 "I don't know of any that do," Alice said very politely, feeling quite
1541 pleased to have got into a conversation.
1542 
1543 "You don't know much," said the Duchess; "and that's a fact."
1544 
1545 Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would
1546 be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she
1547 was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the
1548 fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at
1549 the Duchess and the baby--the fire-irons came first; then followed a
1550 shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of
1551 them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,
1552 that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.
1553 
1554 "Oh, _please_ mind what you're doing!" cried Alice, jumping up and down
1555 in an agony of terror. "Oh, there goes his _precious_ nose"; as an
1556 unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it
1557 off.
1558 
1559 "If everybody minded their own business," the Duchess said in a hoarse
1560 growl, "the world would go round a deal faster than it does."
1561 
1562 [Illustration: _An unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very
1563 nearly carried it off_]
1564 
1565 "Which would _not_ be an advantage," said Alice, who felt very glad to
1566 get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. "Just think
1567 what work it would make with the day and night! You see the earth
1568 takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis----"
1569 
1570 "Talking of axes," said the Duchess, "chop off her head."
1571 
1572 Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take
1573 the hint; but the cook was busily engaged in stirring the soup, and did
1574 not seem to be listening, so she ventured to go on again: "Twenty-four
1575 hours, I _think_; or is it twelve? I----"
1576 
1577 "Oh, don't bother _me_," said the Duchess; "I never could abide
1578 figures!" And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a
1579 sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at
1580 the end of every line:
1581 
1582           "Speak roughly to your little boy,
1583             And beat him when he sneezes:
1584           He only does it to annoy,
1585             Because he knows it teases."
1586 
1587 CHORUS
1588 
1589           (In which the cook and the baby joined):
1590           "Wow! wow! wow!"
1591 
1592 While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing
1593 the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,
1594 that Alice could hardly hear the words:
1595 
1596           "I speak severely to my boy,
1597             I beat him when he sneezes;
1598           For he can thoroughly enjoy
1599             The pepper when he pleases!"
1600 
1601           CHORUS.
1602 
1603           "Wow! wow! wow!"
1604 
1605 "Here! you may nurse it a bit if you like!" the Duchess said to Alice,
1606 flinging the baby at her as she spoke. "I must go and get ready to play
1607 croquet with the Queen," and she hurried out of the room. The cook threw
1608 a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.
1609 
1610 Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped
1611 little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions, "just
1612 like a star-fish," thought Alice. The poor little thing was snorting
1613 like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up and
1614 straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the first minute
1615 or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.
1616 
1617 As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to
1618 twist it up into a knot, and then keep tight hold of its right ear and
1619 left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it out into
1620 the open air. "If I don't take this child away with me," thought Alice,
1621 "they're sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn't it be murder to leave
1622 it behind?" She said the last words out loud, and the little thing
1623 grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time). "Don't grunt,"
1624 said Alice; "that's not at all a proper way of expressing yourself."
1625 
1626 The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to
1627 see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had a
1628 _very_ turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its
1629 eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did not
1630 like the look of the thing at all. "But perhaps it was only sobbing,"
1631 she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there were any
1632 tears.
1633 
1634 No, there were no tears. "If you're going to turn into a pig, my dear,"
1635 said Alice, seriously, "I'll have nothing more to do with you. Mind
1636 now!" The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible
1637 to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.
1638 
1639 Alice was just beginning to think to herself, "Now, what am I to do with
1640 this creature when I get it home?" when it grunted again, so violently,
1641 that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time there could
1642 be _no_ mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and
1643 she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it any further.
1644 
1645 So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it
1646 trot quietly away into the wood. "If it had grown up," she said to
1647 herself, "it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes
1648 rather a handsome pig, I think." And she began thinking over other
1649 children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying
1650 to herself, "if one only knew the right way to change them----" when she
1651 was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a
1652 tree a few yards off.
1653 
1654 [Illustration: _It grunted again so violently that she looked down into
1655 its face in some alarm_]
1656 
1657 The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she
1658 thought: still it had _very_ long claws and a great many teeth, so she
1659 felt that it ought to be treated with respect.
1660 
1661 [Illustration]
1662 
1663 "Cheshire Puss," she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know
1664 whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider.
1665 "Come, it's pleased so far," thought Alice, and she went on. "Would you
1666 tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?"
1667 
1668 "That depends a good deal on where you want to get to," said the Cat.
1669 
1670 "I don't much care where----" said Alice.
1671 
1672 "Then it doesn't matter which way you go," said the Cat.
1673 
1674 "---- so long as I get _somewhere_," Alice added as an explanation.
1675 
1676 "Oh, you're sure to do that," said the Cat, "if you only walk long
1677 enough."
1678 
1679 Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question.
1680 "What sort of people live about here?"
1681 
1682 "In _that_ direction," the Cat said, waving its right paw round, "lives
1683 a Hatter: and in _that_ direction," waving the other paw, "lives a March
1684 Hare. Visit either you like: they're both mad."
1685 
1686 "But I don't want to go among mad people," Alice remarked.
1687 
1688 "Oh, you ca'n't help that," said the Cat: "we're all mad here. I'm mad.
1689 You're mad."
1690 
1691 "How do you know I'm mad?" said Alice.
1692 
1693 "You must be," said the Cat, "or you wouldn't have come here."
1694 
1695 Alice didn't think that proved it at all; however, she went on. "And how
1696 do you know that you're mad?"
1697 
1698 "To begin with," said the Cat, "a dog's not mad. You grant that?"
1699 
1700 "I suppose so," said Alice.
1701 
1702 "Well, then," the Cat went on, "you see a dog growls when it's angry,
1703 and wags its tail when it's pleased. Now _I_ growl when I'm pleased, and
1704 wag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad."
1705 
1706 "_I_ call it purring, not growling," said Alice.
1707 
1708 "Call it what you like," said the Cat. "Do you play croquet with the
1709 Queen to-day?"
1710 
1711 "I should like it very much," said Alice, "but I haven't been invited
1712 yet."
1713 
1714 "You'll see me there," said the Cat and vanished.
1715 
1716 Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer
1717 things happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been,
1718 it suddenly appeared again.
1719 
1720 "By-the-bye, what became of the baby?" said the Cat. "I'd nearly
1721 forgotten to ask."
1722 
1723 "It turned into a pig," Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back
1724 in a natural way.
1725 
1726 "I thought it would," said the Cat, and vanished again.
1727 
1728 Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not
1729 appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in
1730 which the March Hare was said to live. "I've seen hatters before," she
1731 said to herself; "the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and
1732 perhaps as this is May, it won't be raving mad--at least not so mad as
1733 it was in March." As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat
1734 again, sitting on the branch of a tree.
1735 
1736 "Did you say pig, or fig?" said the Cat.
1737 
1738 "I said pig," replied Alice; "and I wish you wouldn't keep appearing and
1739 vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy."
1740 
1741 "All right," said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,
1742 beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which
1743 remained some time after the rest of it had gone.
1744 
1745 "Well! I've often seen a cat without a grin," thought Alice; "but a grin
1746 without a cat! It's the most curious thing I ever saw in all my life."
1747 
1748 [Illustration]
1749 
1750 She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of
1751 the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the
1752 chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It
1753 was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had
1754 nibbled some more of the left-hand bit of mushroom, and raised herself,
1755 to about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather
1756 timidly, saying to herself, "Suppose it should be raving mad after all!
1757 I almost wish I'd gone to see the Hatter instead!"

1761 
1762 CHAPTER VII
1763 
1764 
1765 [Sidenote: _A Mad Tea-party_]
1766 
1767 THERE was a table set out under a tree in front of the
1768 house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a
1769 Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were
1770 using it as a cushion resting their elbows on it, and talking over its
1771 head. "Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse," thought Alice; "only as
1772 it's asleep, suppose it doesn't mind."
1773 
1774 The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at
1775 one corner of it. "No room! No room!" they cried out when they saw Alice
1776 coming. "There's _plenty_ of room!" said Alice indignantly, and she sat
1777 down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.
1778 
1779 "Have some wine," the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.
1780 
1781 Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.
1782 "I don't see any wine," she remarked.
1783 
1784 "There isn't any," said the March Hare.
1785 
1786 "Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it," said Alice angrily.
1787 
1788 "It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being invited," said
1789 the March Hare.
1790 
1791 "I didn't know it was _your_ table," said Alice; "it's laid for a great
1792 many more than three."
1793 
1794 "Your hair wants cutting," said the Hatter. He had been looking at Alice
1795 for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech.
1796 
1797 "You should learn not to make personal remarks," Alice said with some
1798 severity; "it's very rude."
1799 
1800 The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he _said_
1801 was "Why is a raven like a writing-desk?"
1802 
1803 "Come, we shall have some fun now!" thought Alice. "I'm glad they've
1804 begun asking riddles.--I believe I can guess that," she added aloud.
1805 
1806 "Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?" said
1807 the March Hare.
1808 
1809 "Exactly so," said Alice.
1810 
1811 "Then you should say what you mean," the March Hare went on.
1812 
1813 "I do," Alice hastily replied; "at least--at least I mean what I
1814 say--that's the same thing, you know."
1815 
1816 "Not the same thing a bit!" said the Hatter. "Why, you might just as
1817 well say that 'I see what I eat' is the same thing as 'I eat what I
1818 see'!"
1819 
1820 "You might just as well say," added the March Hare, "that 'I like what I
1821 get' is the same thing as 'I get what I like'!"
1822 
1823 "You might just as well say," added the Dormouse, which seemed to be
1824 talking in his sleep, "that 'I breathe when I sleep' is the same thing
1825 as 'I sleep when I breathe'!"
1826 
1827 "It _is_ the same thing with you," said the Hatter; and here the
1828 conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while Alice
1829 thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing-desks,
1830 which wasn't much.
1831 
1832 [Illustration: _A Mad Tea Party_]
1833 
1834 The Hatter was the first to break the silence. "What day of the month
1835 is it?" he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his
1836 pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,
1837 and holding it to his ear.
1838 
1839 Alice considered a little, and then said "The fourth."
1840 
1841 "Two days wrong!" sighed the Hatter. "I told you butter would not suit
1842 the works!" he added, looking angrily at the March Hare.
1843 
1844 "It was the _best_ butter," the March Hare meekly replied.
1845 
1846 "Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well," the Hatter grumbled:
1847 "you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife."
1848 
1849 The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped
1850 it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of
1851 nothing better to say than his first remark, "It was the _best_ butter,
1852 you know."
1853 
1854 Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. "What a
1855 funny watch!" she remarked. "It tells the day of the month, and doesn't
1856 tell what o'clock it is!"
1857 
1858 "Why should it?" muttered the Hatter. "Does _your_ watch tell you what
1859 year it is?"
1860 
1861 "Of course not," Alice replied very readily: "but that's because it
1862 stays the same year for such a long time together."
1863 
1864 "Which is just the case with _mine_," said the Hatter.
1865 
1866 Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter's remark seemed to have no
1867 meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. "I don't quite
1868 understand," she said, as politely as she could.
1869 
1870 "The Dormouse is asleep again," said the Hatter, and he poured a little
1871 hot tea upon its nose.
1872 
1873 The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its
1874 eyes, "Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself."
1875 
1876 "Have you guessed the riddle yet?" the Hatter said, turning to Alice
1877 again.
1878 
1879 "No, I give it up," Alice replied: "what's the answer?"
1880 
1881 "I haven't the slightest idea," said the Hatter.
1882 
1883 "Nor I," said the March Hare.
1884 
1885 Alice sighed wearily. "I think you might do something better with the
1886 time," she said, "than wasting it asking riddles with no answers."
1887 
1888 "If you knew Time as well as I do," said the Hatter, "you wouldn't talk
1889 about wasting _it_. It's _him_."
1890 
1891 "I don't know what you mean," said Alice.
1892 
1893 "Of course you don't!" the Hatter said, tossing his head contemptuously.
1894 "I daresay you never spoke to Time!"
1895 
1896 "Perhaps not," Alice cautiously replied: "but I know I have to beat time
1897 when I learn music."
1898 
1899 "Ah! that accounts for it," said the Hatter. "He won't stand beating.
1900 Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do almost anything
1901 you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o'clock in
1902 the morning, just time to begin lessons: you'd only have to whisper a
1903 hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,
1904 time for dinner!"
1905 
1906 ("I only wish it was," the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)
1907 
1908 "That would be grand, certainly," said Alice thoughtfully: "but then--I
1909 shouldn't be hungry for it, you know."
1910 
1911 "Not at first, perhaps," said the Hatter: "but you could keep it to
1912 half-past one as long as you liked."
1913 
1914 "Is that the way _you_ manage?" Alice asked.
1915 
1916 The Hatter shook his head mournfully. "Not I!" he replied. "We
1917 quarrelled last March----just before _he_ went mad, you know----"
1918 (pointing with his teaspoon to the March Hare), "it was at the great
1919 concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing
1920 
1921           'Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!
1922           How I wonder what you're at!'
1923 
1924 You know that song, perhaps?"
1925 
1926 "I've heard something like it," said Alice.
1927 
1928 "It goes on, you know," the Hatter continued, "in this way:--
1929 
1930           'Up above the world you fly,
1931           Like a tea-tray in the sky.
1932                       Twinkle, twinkle----'"
1933 
1934 Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep
1935 "_Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle_----" and went on so long that they
1936 had to pinch it to make it stop.
1937 
1938 "Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse," said the Hatter, "when the
1939 Queen jumped up and bawled out 'He's murdering the time! Off with his
1940 head!'"
1941 
1942 "How dreadfully savage!" exclaimed Alice.
1943 
1944 "And ever since that," the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, "he won't
1945 do a thing I ask! It's always six o'clock now."
1946 
1947 A bright idea came into Alice's head. "Is that the reason so many
1948 tea-things are put out here?" she asked.
1949 
1950 "Yes, that's it," said the Hatter with a sigh: "it's always tea-time,
1951 and we've no time to wash the things between whiles."
1952 
1953 "Then you keep moving round, I suppose?" said Alice.
1954 
1955 "Exactly so," said the Hatter: "as the things get used up."
1956 
1957 "But what happens when you come to the beginning again?" Alice ventured
1958 to ask.
1959 
1960 "Suppose we change the subject," the March Hare interrupted, yawning.
1961 "I'm getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story."
1962 
1963 "I'm afraid I don't know one," said Alice, rather alarmed at the
1964 proposal.
1965 
1966 "Then the Dormouse shall!" they both cried. "Wake up, Dormouse!" And
1967 they pinched it on both sides at once.
1968 
1969 The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. "I wasn't asleep," he said in a
1970 hoarse, feeble voice: "I heard every word you fellows were saying."
1971 
1972 "Tell us a story!" said the March Hare.
1973 
1974 "Yes, please do!" pleaded Alice.
1975 
1976 "And be quick about it," added the Hatter, "or you'll be asleep again
1977 before it's done."
1978 
1979 "Once upon a time there were three little sisters," the Dormouse began
1980 in a great hurry; "and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and
1981 they lived at the bottom of a well----"
1982 
1983 "What did they live on?" said Alice, who always took a great interest in
1984 questions of eating and drinking.
1985 
1986 "They lived on treacle," said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or
1987 two.
1988 
1989 "They couldn't have done that, you know," Alice gently remarked; "they'd
1990 have been ill."
1991 
1992 "So they were," said the Dormouse; "_very_ ill."
1993 
1994 Alice tried a little to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary way
1995 of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on:
1996 "But why did they live at the bottom of a well?"
1997 
1998 "Take some more tea," the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.
1999 
2000 "I've had nothing yet," Alice replied in an offended tone, "so I can't
2001 take more."
2002 
2003 "You mean you can't take _less_," said the Hatter; "it's very easy to
2004 take _more_ than nothing."
2005 
2006 "Nobody asked _your_ opinion," said Alice.
2007 
2008 "Who's making personal remarks now?" the Hatter asked triumphantly.
2009 
2010 Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to
2011 some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and
2012 repeated her question. "Why did they live at the bottom of a well?"
2013 
2014 The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then
2015 said, "It was a treacle-well."
2016 
2017 "There's no such thing!" Alice was beginning very angrily, but the
2018 Hatter and the March Hare went "Sh! sh!" and the Dormouse sulkily
2019 remarked: "If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the story for
2020 yourself."
2021 
2022 "No, please go on!" Alice said very humbly. "I won't interrupt you
2023 again. I dare say there may be _one_."
2024 
2025 "One, indeed!" said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to
2026 go on. "And so these three little sisters--they were learning to draw,
2027 you know----"
2028 
2029 "What did they draw?" said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.
2030 
2031 "Treacle," said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.
2032 
2033 "I want a clean cup," interrupted the Hatter: "let's all move one place
2034 on."
2035 
2036 He moved as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare
2037 moved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the
2038 place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any
2039 advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than
2040 before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.
2041 
2042 Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very
2043 cautiously: "But I don't understand. Where did they draw the treacle
2044 from?"
2045 
2046 "You can draw water out of a water-well," said the Hatter; "so I should
2047 think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh, stupid!"
2048 
2049 "But they were _in_ the well," Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing
2050 to notice this last remark.
2051 
2052 "Of course they were," said the Dormouse; "----well in."
2053 
2054 This answer so confused poor Alice that she let the Dormouse go on for
2055 some time without interrupting it.
2056 
2057 "They were learning to draw," the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing
2058 its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; "and they drew all manner of
2059 things--everything that begins with an M----"
2060 
2061 "Why with an M?" said Alice.
2062 
2063 "Why not?" said the March Hare.
2064 
2065 Alice was silent.
2066 
2067 The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a
2068 dose; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a
2069 little shriek, and went on: "----that begins with an M, such as
2070 mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--you know you say
2071 things are 'much of a muchness'--did you ever see such a thing as a
2072 drawing of a muchness?"
2073 
2074 "Really, now you ask me," said Alice, very much confused, "I don't
2075 think----"
2076 
2077 "Then you shouldn't talk," said the Hatter.
2078 
2079 This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in
2080 great disgust and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and
2081 neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she
2082 looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:
2083 the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into
2084 the teapot.
2085 
2086 "At any rate I'll never go _there_ again!" said Alice as she picked her
2087 way through the wood. "It's the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in all
2088 my life!"
2089 
2090 Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door
2091 leading right into it. "That's very curious!" she thought. "But
2092 everything's curious to-day. I think I may as well go in at once." And
2093 in she went.
2094 
2095 Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little
2096 glass table. "Now I'll manage better this time," she said to herself,
2097 and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that
2098 led into the garden. Then she set to work nibbling at the mushroom (she
2099 had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high:
2100 then she walked down the little passage: and _then_--she found herself
2101 at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the
2102 cool fountains.
2103 
2104 
2105 
2106 
2107 CHAPTER VIII
2108 
2109 
2110 [Sidenote: _The Queen's Croquet-Ground_]
2111 
2112 A LARGE rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden:
2113 the roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at
2114 it, busily painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing,
2115 and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she
2116 heard one of them say "Look out now, Five! Don't go splashing paint over
2117 me like that!"
2118 
2119 "I couldn't help it," said Five, in a sulky tone. "Seven jogged my
2120 elbow."
2121 
2122 On which Seven looked up and said, "That's right, Five! Always lay the
2123 blame on others!"
2124 
2125 "_You'd_ better not talk!" said Five. "I heard the Queen say only
2126 yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!"
2127 
2128 "What for?" said the one who had first spoken.
2129 
2130 "That's none of _your_ business, Two!" said Seven.
2131 
2132 "Yes, it _is_ his business!" said Five. "And I'll tell him--it was for
2133 bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions."
2134 
2135 Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun "Well, of all the unjust
2136 things----" when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood
2137 watching them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round
2138 also, and all of them bowed low.
2139 
2140 "Would you tell me," said Alice, a little timidly, "why you are painting
2141 those roses?"
2142 
2143 Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low
2144 voice, "Why, the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a
2145 _red_ rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen
2146 was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So
2147 you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore she comes, to----" At this
2148 moment, Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called
2149 out "The Queen! The Queen!" and the three gardeners instantly threw
2150 themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps,
2151 and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.
2152 
2153 First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the
2154 three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the
2155 corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with
2156 diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came
2157 the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came
2158 jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples; they were all ornamented
2159 with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among
2160 them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried,
2161 nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without
2162 noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King's
2163 crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and last of all this grand
2164 procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.
2165 
2166 Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face
2167 like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard
2168 of such a rule at processions; "and besides, what would be the use of a
2169 procession," thought she, "if people had to lie down upon their faces,
2170 so that they couldn't see it?" So she stood still where she was, and
2171 waited.
2172 
2173 When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked
2174 at her, and the Queen said severely, "Who is this?" She said it to the
2175 Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.
2176 
2177 "Idiot!" said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and turning to
2178 Alice, she went on, "What's your name, child?"
2179 
2180 "My name is Alice, so please your Majesty," said Alice very politely;
2181 but she added, to herself, "Why, they're only a pack of cards, after
2182 all. I needn't be afraid of them!"
2183 
2184 "And who are _these_?" said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners
2185 who were lying round the rose-tree; for, you see, as they were lying on
2186 their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of
2187 the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers,
2188 or courtiers, or three of her own children.
2189 
2190 "How should _I_ know?" said Alice, surprised at her own courage. "It's
2191 no business of _mine_."
2192 
2193 The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a
2194 moment like a wild beast, screamed "Off with her head! Off----"
2195 
2196 "Nonsense!" said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was
2197 silent.
2198 
2199 The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said "Consider my dear:
2200 she is only a child!"
2201 
2202 The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave "Turn them
2203 over!"
2204 
2205 The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.
2206 
2207 "Get up!" said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three
2208 gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen,
2209 the royal children, and everybody else.
2210 
2211 "Leave off that!" screamed the Queen. "You make me giddy." And then,
2212 turning to the rose-tree, she went on, "What _have_ you been doing
2213 here?"
2214 
2215 "May it please your Majesty," said Two, in a very humble tone, going
2216 down on one knee as he spoke, "we were trying----"
2217 
2218 [Illustration: _The Queen turned angrily away from him and said to the
2219 Knave, "Turn them over"_]
2220 
2221 "_I_ see!" said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.
2222 "Off with their heads!" and the procession moved on, three of the
2223 soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran
2224 to Alice for protection.
2225 
2226 "You shan't be beheaded!" said Alice, and she put them into a large
2227 flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a
2228 minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the
2229 others.
2230 
2231 "Are their heads off?" shouted the Queen.
2232 
2233 "Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!" the soldiers shouted
2234 in reply.
2235 
2236 "That's right!" shouted the Queen. "Can you play croquet?"
2237 
2238 The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was
2239 evidently meant for her.
2240 
2241 "Yes!" shouted Alice.
2242 
2243 "Come on, then!" roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,
2244 wondering very much what would happen next.
2245 
2246 "It's--it's a very fine day!" said a timid voice at her side. She was
2247 walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.
2248 
2249 "Very," said Alice: "----where's the Duchess?"
2250 
2251 "Hush! Hush!" said the Rabbit in a low hurried tone. He looked anxiously
2252 over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon tiptoe, put
2253 his mouth close to her ear, and whispered "She's under sentence of
2254 execution."
2255 
2256 "What for?" said Alice.
2257 
2258 "Did you say 'What a pity!'?" the Rabbit asked.
2259 
2260 "No, I didn't," said Alice: "I don't think it's at all a pity. I said
2261 'What for?'"
2262 
2263 "She boxed the Queen's ears--" the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little
2264 scream of laughter. "Oh, hush!" the Rabbit whispered in a frightened
2265 tone. "The Queen will hear you! You see she came rather late, and the
2266 Queen said----"
2267 
2268 "Get to your places!" shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and
2269 people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each
2270 other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game
2271 began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in
2272 all her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live
2273 hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double
2274 themselves up and to stand upon their hands and feet, to make the
2275 arches.
2276 
2277 [Illustration]
2278 
2279 The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo;
2280 she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under
2281 her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got
2282 its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a
2283 blow with its head, it _would_ twist itself round and look up in her
2284 face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting
2285 out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to
2286 begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had
2287 unrolled itself and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this,
2288 there was generally a ridge or a furrow in the way wherever she wanted
2289 to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always
2290 getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came
2291 to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.
2292 
2293 The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling
2294 all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time
2295 the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and
2296 shouting "Off with his head!" or "Off with her head!" about once in a
2297 minute.
2298 
2299 Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure she had not as yet had any
2300 dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,
2301 "and then," thought she, "what would become of me? They're dreadfully
2302 fond of beheading people here: the great wonder is that there's any one
2303 left alive!"
2304 
2305 She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she
2306 could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious
2307 appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after
2308 watching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said
2309 to herself "It's the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk
2310 to."
2311 
2312 "How are you getting on?" said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth
2313 enough for it to speak with.
2314 
2315 Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. "It's no use
2316 speaking to it," she thought, "till its ears have come, or at least one
2317 of them." In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put
2318 down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad
2319 she had some one to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there
2320 was enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.
2321 
2322 "I don't think they play at all fairly," Alice began, in rather a
2323 complaining tone, "and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't hear
2324 oneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules in particular; at
2325 least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and you've no idea how
2326 confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there's the
2327 arch I've got to go through next walking about at the other end of the
2328 ground--and I should have croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, only
2329 it ran away when it saw mine coming!"
2330 
2331 [Illustration]
2332 
2333 "How do you like the Queen?" said the Cat in a low voice.
2334 
2335 "Not at all," said Alice: "she's so extremely----" Just then she noticed
2336 that the Queen was close behind her listening: so she went on,
2337 "----likely to win, that it's hardly worth while finishing the game."
2338 
2339 The Queen smiled and passed on.
2340 
2341 "Who _are_ you talking to?" said the King, coming up to Alice, and
2342 looking at the Cat's head with great curiosity.
2343 
2344 "It's a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat," said Alice: "allow me to
2345 introduce it."
2346 
2347 "I don't like the look of it at all," said the King: "however, it may
2348 kiss my hand if it likes."
2349 
2350 "I'd rather not," the Cat remarked.
2351 
2352 "Don't be impertinent," said the King, "and don't look at me like that!"
2353 He got behind Alice as he spoke.
2354 
2355 "A cat may look at a king," said Alice. "I've read that in some book,
2356 but I don't remember where."
2357 
2358 "Well, it must be removed," said the King very decidedly, and he called
2359 to the Queen, who was passing at the moment, "My dear! I wish you would
2360 have this cat removed!"
2361 
2362 The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small.
2363 "Off with his head!" she said, without even looking round.
2364 
2365 "I'll fetch the executioner myself," said the King eagerly, and he
2366 hurried off.
2367 
2368 Alice thought she might as well go back and see how the game was going
2369 on, as she heard the Queen's voice in the distance, screaming with
2370 passion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be
2371 executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look of
2372 things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew
2373 whether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.
2374 
2375 The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed
2376 to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the
2377 other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the
2378 other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a helpless
2379 sort of way to fly up into one of the trees.
2380 
2381 By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight
2382 was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: "but it doesn't
2383 matter much," thought Alice, "as all the arches are gone from this side
2384 of the ground." So she tucked it under her arm, that it might not escape
2385 again, and went back for a little more conversation with her friend.
2386 
2387 When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite a
2388 large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between the
2389 executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,
2390 while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.
2391 
2392 The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle
2393 the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they
2394 all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly
2395 what they said.
2396 
2397 [Illustration]
2398 
2399 The executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a head unless
2400 there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a
2401 thing before, and he wasn't going to begin at _his_ time of life.
2402 
2403 The King's argument was, that anything that had a head could be
2404 beheaded, and that you weren't to talk nonsense.
2405 
2406 The Queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done about it in less
2407 than no time, she'd have everybody executed all round. (It was this last
2408 remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.)
2409 
2410 Alice could think of nothing else to say but "It belongs to the Duchess:
2411 you'd better ask _her_ about it."
2412 
2413 "She's in prison," the Queen said to the executioner; "fetch her here."
2414 And the executioner went off like an arrow.
2415 
2416 The Cat's head began fading away the moment he was gone, and by the time
2417 he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so the
2418 King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it, while
2419 the rest of the party went back to the game.
2420

2423 
2424 CHAPTER IX
2425 
2426 
2427 [Sidenote: _The Mock Turtle's Story_]
2428 
2429 "YOU can't think how glad I am to see you again, you
2430 dear old thing!" said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately
2431 into Alice's, and they walked off together.
2432 
2433 Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought
2434 to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so
2435 savage when they met in the kitchen.
2436 
2437 "When _I'm_ a Duchess," she said to herself (not in a very hopeful tone
2438 though), "I won't have any pepper in my kitchen _at all_. Soup does very
2439 well without--Maybe it's always pepper that makes people hot-tempered,"
2440 she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule,
2441 "and vinegar that makes them sour--and camomile that makes them
2442 bitter--and--barley-sugar and such things that make children
2443 sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew _that_: then they wouldn't be
2444 so stingy about it, you know----"
2445 
2446 She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little
2447 startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. "You're thinking
2448 about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can't
2449 tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in
2450 a bit."
2451 
2452 "Perhaps it hasn't one," Alice ventured to remark.
2453 
2454 "Tut, tut, child!" said the Duchess. "Every thing's got a moral, if only
2455 you can find it." And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice's side as
2456 she spoke.
2457 
2458 Alice did not much like her keeping so close to her: first, because the
2459 Duchess was _very_ ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the right
2460 height to rest her chin on Alice's shoulder, and it was an uncomfortably
2461 sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she bore it as well
2462 as she could. "The game's going on rather better now," she said, by way
2463 of keeping up the conversation a little.
2464 
2465 "'Tis so," said the Duchess: "and the moral of that is--'Oh, 'tis love,
2466 'tis love, that makes the world go round!'"
2467 
2468 "Somebody said," Alice whispered, "that it's done by everybody minding
2469 their own business!"
2470 
2471 "Ah, well! It means much the same thing," said the Duchess, digging her
2472 sharp little chin into Alice's shoulder as she added, "and the moral of
2473 _that_ is--'Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of
2474 themselves.'"
2475 
2476 "How fond she is of finding morals in things!" Alice thought to herself.
2477 
2478 "I dare say you're wondering why I don't put my arm round your waist,"
2479 the Duchess said after a pause: "the reason is, that I'm doubtful about
2480 the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?"
2481 
2482 "He might bite," Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious to
2483 have the experiment tried.
2484 
2485 "Very true," said the Duchess: "flamingoes and mustard both bite. And
2486 the moral of that is--'Birds of a feather flock together.'"
2487 
2488 "Only mustard isn't a bird," Alice remarked.
2489 
2490 "Right, as usual," said the Duchess: "what a clear way you have of
2491 putting things!"
2492 
2493 "It's a mineral, I _think_," said Alice.
2494 
2495 "Of course it is," said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to
2496 everything that Alice said: "there's a large mustard-mine near here. And
2497 the moral of that is--'The more there is of mine, the less there is of
2498 yours.'"
2499 
2500 "Oh, I know!" exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last remark.
2501 "It's a vegetable. It doesn't look like one, but it is."
2502 
2503 "I quite agree with you," said the Duchess; "and the moral of that
2504 is--'Be what you would seem to be'--or if you'd like it put more
2505 simply--'Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might
2506 appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise
2507 than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise.'"
2508 
2509 "I think I should understand that better," Alice said very politely, "if
2510 I had it written down: but I can't quite follow it as you say it."
2511 
2512 "That's nothing to what I could say if I chose," the Duchess replied, in
2513 a pleased tone.
2514 
2515 "Pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that," said
2516 Alice.
2517 
2518 "Oh, don't talk about trouble!" said the Duchess. "I make you a present
2519 of everything I've said as yet."
2520 
2521 "A cheap sort of present!" thought Alice. "I'm glad they don't give
2522 birthday presents like that!" But she did not venture to say it out
2523 loud.
2524 
2525 "Thinking again?" the Duchess asked with another dig of her sharp little
2526 chin.
2527 
2528 "I've a right to think," said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to
2529 feel a little worried.
2530 
2531 "Just about as much right," said the Duchess, "as pigs have to fly; and
2532 the m----"
2533 
2534 But here, to Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's voice died away, even
2535 in the middle of her favourite word "moral," and the arm that was linked
2536 into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the Queen
2537 in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm.
2538 
2539 "A fine day, your Majesty!" the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.
2540 
2541 "Now, I give you fair warning," shouted the Queen, stamping on the
2542 ground as she spoke; "either you or your head must be off, and that in
2543 about half no time! Take your choice!"
2544 
2545 The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.
2546 
2547 "Let's go on with the game," the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too
2548 much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the
2549 croquet-ground.
2550 
2551 The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen's absence, and were
2552 resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried
2553 back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment's delay would
2554 cost them their lives.
2555 
2556 [Illustration: _The Queen never left off quarrelling with the other
2557 players, and shouting "Off with his head!" or, "Off with her head!"_]
2558 
2559 All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with
2560 the other players, and shouting "Off with his head!" or "Off with her
2561 head!" Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers,
2562 who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that by the
2563 end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and all the
2564 players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and
2565 under sentence of execution.
2566 
2567 Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, "Have
2568 you seen the Mock Turtle yet?"
2569 
2570 "No," said Alice. "I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is."
2571 
2572 "It's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from," said the Queen.
2573 
2574 "I never saw one, or heard of one," said Alice.
2575 
2576 "Come on then," said the Queen, "and he shall tell you his history."
2577 
2578 As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice, to
2579 the company generally, "You are all pardoned." "Come, _that's_ a good
2580 thing!" she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the
2581 number of executions the Queen had ordered.
2582 
2583 They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. (If
2584 you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) "Up, lazy
2585 thing!" said the Queen, "and take this young lady to see the Mock
2586 Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some
2587 executions I have ordered," and she walked off, leaving Alice alone
2588 with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but
2589 on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to
2590 go after that savage Queen: so she waited.
2591 
2592 The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till
2593 she was out of sight: then it chuckled. "What fun!" said the Gryphon,
2594 half to itself, half to Alice.
2595 
2596 "What _is_ the fun?" said Alice.
2597 
2598 "Why, _she_," said the Gryphon. "It's all her fancy, that: they never
2599 executes nobody, you know. Come on!"
2600 
2601 "Everybody says 'come on!' here," thought Alice, as she went slowly
2602 after it: "I never was so ordered about in my life, never!"
2603 
2604 [Illustration]
2605 
2606 They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,
2607 sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came
2608 nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She
2609 pitied him deeply. "What is his sorrow?" she asked the Gryphon, and the
2610 Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, "It's all
2611 his fancy, that: he hasn't got no sorrow, you know. Come on!"
2612 
2613 So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes
2614 full of tears, but said nothing.
2615 
2616 "This here young lady," said the Gryphon, "she wants to know your
2617 history, she do."
2618 
2619 "I'll tell it her," said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone; "sit
2620 down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've finished."
2621 
2622 So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to
2623 herself, "I don't see how he can _ever_ finish, if he doesn't begin."
2624 But she waited patiently.
2625 
2626 "Once," said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, "I was a real
2627 Turtle."
2628 
2629 These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an
2630 occasional exclamation of "Hjckrrh!" from the Gryphon, and the constant
2631 heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and
2632 saying "Thank you, sir, for your interesting story," but she could not
2633 help thinking there _must_ be more to come, so she sat still and said
2634 nothing.
2635 
2636 "When we were little," the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,
2637 though still sobbing a little now and then, "we went to school in the
2638 sea. The master was an old Turtle--we used to call him Tortoise----"
2639 
2640 "Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?" Alice asked.
2641 
2642 "We called him Tortoise because he taught us," said the Mock Turtle
2643 angrily: "really you are very dull!"
2644 
2645 "You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,"
2646 added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor
2647 Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the Gryphon said
2648 to the Mock Turtle, "Drive on, old fellow. Don't be all day about it!"
2649 and he went on in these words:
2650 
2651 "Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe it----"
2652 
2653 "I never said I didn't!" interrupted Alice.
2654 
2655 "You did," said the Mock Turtle.
2656 
2657 "Hold your tongue!" added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.
2658 The Mock Turtle went on:--
2659 
2660 "We had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school every
2661 day----"
2662 
2663 "_I've_ been to a day-school, too," said Alice; "you needn't be so proud
2664 as all that."
2665 
2666 "With extras?" asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.
2667 
2668 "Yes," said Alice, "we learned French and music."
2669 
2670 "And washing?" said the Mock Turtle.
2671 
2672 "Certainly not!" said Alice indignantly.
2673 
2674 "Ah! then yours wasn't a really good school," said the Mock Turtle in a
2675 tone of relief. "Now at _ours_ they had at the end of the bill, 'French,
2676 music, _and washing_--extra.'"
2677 
2678 "You couldn't have wanted it much," said Alice; "living at the bottom of
2679 the sea."
2680 
2681 "I couldn't afford to learn it," said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. "I
2682 only took the regular course."
2683 
2684 "What was that?" inquired Alice.
2685 
2686 "Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with," the Mock Turtle
2687 replied; "and then the different branches of Arithmetic--Ambition,
2688 Distraction, Uglification, and Derision."
2689 
2690 "I never heard of 'Uglification,'" Alice ventured to say. "What is it?"
2691 
2692 The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. "Never heard of
2693 uglifying!" it exclaimed. "You know what to beautify is, I suppose?"
2694 
2695 "Yes," said Alice doubtfully: "it means--to--make--anything--prettier."
2696 
2697 "Well, then," the Gryphon went on, "if you don't know what to uglify is,
2698 you are a simpleton."
2699 
2700 Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she
2701 turned to the Mock Turtle and said, "What else had you to learn?"
2702 
2703 "Well, there was Mystery," the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the
2704 subjects on his flappers, "--Mystery, ancient and modern, with
2705 Seaography: then Drawling--the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel,
2706 that used to come once a week: _he_ taught us Drawling, Stretching, and
2707 Fainting in Coils."
2708 
2709 "What was _that_ like?" said Alice.
2710 
2711 "Well, I can't show it you myself," the Mock Turtle said: "I'm too
2712 stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it."
2713 
2714 "Hadn't time," said the Gryphon: "I went to the Classical master,
2715 though. He was an old crab, _he_ was."
2716 
2717 "I never went to him," the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: "he taught
2718 Laughing and Grief, they used to say."
2719 
2720 "So he did, so he did," said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both
2721 creatures hid their faces in their paws.
2722 
2723 "And how many hours a day did you do lessons?" said Alice, in a hurry to
2724 change the subject.
2725 
2726 "Ten hours the first day," said the Mock Turtle: "nine the next, and so
2727 on."
2728 
2729 "What a curious plan!" exclaimed Alice.
2730 
2731 "That's the reason they're called lessons," the Gryphon remarked:
2732 "because they lessen from day to day."
2733 
2734 This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought over it a little
2735 before she made her next remark. "Then the eleventh day must have been a
2736 holiday."
2737 
2738 "Of course it was," said the Mock Turtle.
2739 
2740 "And how did you manage on the twelfth?" Alice went on eagerly.
2741 
2742 "That's enough about lessons," the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided
2743 tone: "tell her something about the games now."
2744 
2745 
2746 
2747 
2748 CHAPTER X
2749 
2750 
2751 [Sidenote: _The Lobster Quadrille_]
2752 
2753 THE Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one
2754 flapper across his eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but,
2755 for a minute or two, sobs choked his voice. "Same as if he had a bone in
2756 his throat," said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and
2757 punching him in the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice,
2758 and, with tears running down his cheeks, went on again:
2759 
2760 "You may not have lived much under the sea--" ("I haven't," said Alice)
2761 "and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster--" (Alice began
2762 to say "I once tasted----" but checked herself hastily, and said "No,
2763 never") "--so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a Lobster
2764 Quadrille is!"
2765 
2766 "No, indeed," said Alice. "What sort of a dance is it?"
2767 
2768 "Why," said the Gryphon, "you first form into a line along the
2769 sea-shore----"
2770 
2771 "Two lines!" cried the Mock Turtle. "Seals, turtles, and so on; then,
2772 when you've cleared the jelly-fish out of the way----"
2773 
2774 "_That_ generally takes some time," interrupted the Gryphon.
2775 
2776 "--you advance twice----"
2777 
2778 "Each with a lobster as a partner!" cried the Gryphon.
2779 
2780 "Of course," the Mock Turtle said: "advance twice, set to partners----"
2781 
2782 "--change lobsters, and retire in same order," continued the Gryphon.
2783 
2784 "Then, you know," the Mock Turtle went on, "you throw the----"
2785 
2786 "The lobsters!" shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.
2787 
2788 "--as far out to sea as you can----"
2789 
2790 "Swim, after them!" screamed the Gryphon.
2791 
2792 "Turn a somersault in the sea!" cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly
2793 about.
2794 
2795 "Change lobsters again!" yelled the Gryphon.
2796 
2797 "Back to land again, and--that's all the first figure," said the Mock
2798 Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had been
2799 jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very sadly
2800 and quietly, and looked at Alice.
2801 
2802 "It must be a very pretty dance," said Alice, timidly.
2803 
2804 "Would you like to see a little of it?" said the Mock Turtle.
2805 
2806 "Very much indeed," said Alice.
2807 
2808 "Come, let's try the first figure!" said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon.
2809 "We can do it without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?"
2810 
2811 "Oh, _you_ sing," said the Gryphon. "I've forgotten the words."
2812 
2813 So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and then
2814 treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their
2815 forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly
2816 and sadly:--
2817 
2818   "Will you walk a little faster?" said a whiting to a snail,
2819   "There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my tail.
2820   See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!
2821   They are waiting on the shingle--will you come and join the dance?
2822     Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance?
2823     Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance?
2824 
2825   "You can really have no notion how delightful it will be,
2826   When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!"
2827   But the snail replied: "Too far, too far!" and gave a look askance--
2828   Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.
2829     Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.
2830     Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.
2831 
2832   "What matters it how far we go?" his scaly friend replied;
2833   "There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.
2834   The further off from England the nearer is to France--
2835   Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.
2836     Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance?
2837     Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance?"
2838 
2839 "Thank you, it's a very interesting dance to watch," said Alice, feeling
2840 very glad that it was over at last: "and I do so like that curious song
2841 about the whiting!"
2842 
2843 "Oh, as to the whiting," said the Mock Turtle, "they--you've seen them,
2844 of course?"
2845 
2846 "Yes," said Alice, "I've often seen them at dinn----" she checked
2847 herself hastily.
2848 
2849 "I don't know where Dinn may be," said the Mock Turtle, "but if you've
2850 seen them so often, of course you know what they're like."
2851 
2852 "I believe so," Alice replied thoughtfully. "They have their tails in
2853 their mouths--and they're all over crumbs."
2854 
2855 "You're wrong about the crumbs," said the Mock Turtle: "crumbs would all
2856 wash off in the sea. But they _have_ their tails in their mouths; and
2857 the reason is--" here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his eyes. "Tell
2858 her about the reason and all that," he said to the Gryphon.
2859 
2860 "The reason is," said the Gryphon, "that they _would_ go with the
2861 lobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to
2862 fall a long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they
2863 couldn't get them out again. That's all."
2864 
2865 "Thank you," said Alice. "It's very interesting. I never knew so much
2866 about a whiting before."
2867 
2868 "I can tell you more than that, if you like," said the Gryphon. "Do you
2869 know why it's called a whiting?"
2870 
2871 "I never thought about it," said Alice. "Why?"
2872 
2873 "_It does the boots and shoes_," the Gryphon replied very solemnly.
2874 
2875 Alice was thoroughly puzzled. "Does the boots and shoes!" she repeated
2876 in a wondering tone.
2877 
2878 "Why, what are _your_ shoes done with?" said the Gryphon. "I mean, what
2879 makes them so shiny?"
2880 
2881 Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her
2882 answer. "They're done with blacking, I believe."
2883 
2884 "Boots and shoes under the sea," the Gryphon went on in a deep voice,
2885 "are done with whiting. Now you know."
2886 
2887 "And what are they made of?" Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.
2888 
2889 "Soles and eels, of course," the Gryphon replied rather impatiently:
2890 "any shrimp could have told you that."
2891 
2892 "If I'd been the whiting," said Alice, whose thoughts were still running
2893 on the song, "I'd have said to the porpoise, 'Keep back, please: we
2894 don't want _you_ with us!'"
2895 
2896 "They were obliged to have him with them," the Mock Turtle said: "no
2897 wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise."
2898 
2899 "Wouldn't it really?" said Alice in a tone of great surprise.
2900 
2901 "Of course not," said the Mock Turtle: "why, if a fish came to _me_, and
2902 told me he was going a journey, I should say, 'With what porpoise?'"
2903 
2904 "Don't you mean 'purpose'?" said Alice.
2905 
2906 "I mean what I say," the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And
2907 the Gryphon added, "Come, let's hear some of _your_ adventures."
2908 
2909 [Illustration: _The Mock Turtle drew a long breath and said, "That's
2910 very curious"_]
2911 
2912 "I could tell you my adventures--beginning from this morning," said
2913 Alice a little timidly: "but it's no use going back to yesterday,
2914 because I was a different person then."
2915 
2916 "Explain all that," said the Mock Turtle.
2917 
2918 "No, no! The adventures first," said the Gryphon in an impatient tone:
2919 "explanations take such a dreadful time."
2920 
2921 So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first
2922 saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first,
2923 the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened
2924 their eyes and mouths so _very_ wide, but she gained courage as she went
2925 on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about
2926 her repeating "_You are old, Father William_," to the Caterpillar, and
2927 the words all coming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long
2928 breath, and said, "That's very curious."
2929 
2930 "It's all about as curious as it can be," said the Gryphon.
2931 
2932 "It all came different!" the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. "I
2933 should like to hear her repeat something now. Tell her to begin." He
2934 looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority
2935 over Alice.
2936 
2937 "Stand up and repeat '_'Tis the voice of the sluggard_,'" said the
2938 Gryphon.
2939 
2940 "How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!"
2941 thought Alice. "I might as well be at school at once." However, she got
2942 up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster
2943 Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came
2944 very queer indeed:--
2945 
2946           "'Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,
2947           'You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.'
2948           As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose
2949           Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.
2950           When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,
2951           And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark:
2952           But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,
2953           His voice has a timid and tremulous sound."
2954 
2955 "That's different from what _I_ used to say when I was a child," said
2956 the Gryphon.
2957 
2958 "Well, _I_ never heard it before," said the Mock Turtle: "but it sounds
2959 uncommon nonsense."
2960 
2961 Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,
2962 wondering if anything would _ever_ happen in a natural way again.
2963 
2964 "I should like to have it explained," said the Mock Turtle.
2965 
2966 "She ca'n't explain it," hastily said the Gryphon. "Go on with the next
2967 verse."
2968 
2969 "But about his toes?" the Mock Turtle persisted. "How _could_ he turn
2970 them out with his nose, you know?"
2971 
2972 "It's the first position in dancing," Alice said; but was dreadfully
2973 puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.
2974 
2975 "Go on with the next verse," the Gryphon repeated: "it begins '_I passed
2976 by his garden_.'"
2977 
2978 Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come
2979 wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:
2980 
2981           "I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,
2982           How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie:
2983           The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,
2984           While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.
2985           When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,
2986           Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:
2987           While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,
2988           And concluded the banquet by----"
2989 
2990 "What _is_ the use of repeating all that stuff," the Mock Turtle
2991 interrupted, "if you don't explain it as you go on? It's by far the most
2992 confusing thing _I_ ever heard!"
2993 
2994 [Illustration]
2995 
2996 "Yes, I think you'd better leave off," said the Gryphon: and Alice was
2997 only too glad to do so.
2998 
2999 "Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?" the Gryphon went
3000 on. "Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you another song?"
3001 
3002 "Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind," Alice
3003 replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone,
3004 "H'm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her '_Turtle Soup_,' will you, old
3005 fellow?"
3006 
3007 The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice choked with sobs,
3008 to sing this:--
3009 
3010           "Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,
3011           Waiting in a hot tureen!
3012           Who for such dainties would not stoop?
3013           Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
3014           Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
3015               Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
3016               Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
3017           Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,
3018               Beautiful, beautiful Soup!
3019 
3020           "Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,
3021           Game, or any other dish?
3022           Who would not give all else for two
3023           Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
3024           Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
3025               Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
3026               Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
3027           Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,
3028               Beautiful, beauti--FUL SOUP!"
3029 
3030 "Chorus again!" cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun
3031 to repeat it, when a cry of "The trial's beginning!" was heard in the
3032 distance.
3033 
3034 "Come on!" cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried
3035 off, without waiting for the end of the song.
3036 
3037 "What trial is it?" Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only
3038 answered "Come on!" and ran the faster, while more and more faintly
3039 came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:--
3040 
3041           "Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,
3042               Beautiful, beautiful Soup!"
3043 
3044 
3045 
3046 
3047 CHAPTER XI
3048 
3049 
3050 [Sidenote: _Who Stole the Tarts?_]
3051 
3052 THE King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne
3053 when they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts of
3054 little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave
3055 was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to
3056 guard him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one
3057 hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the
3058 court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so
3059 good, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them--"I wish they'd
3060 get the trial done," she thought, "and hand round the refreshments!" But
3061 there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking about her, to
3062 pass away the time.
3063 
3064 Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read
3065 about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the
3066 name of nearly everything there. "That's the judge," she said to
3067 herself, "because of his great wig."
3068 
3069 The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the
3070 wig, he did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not
3071 becoming.
3072 
3073 "And that's the jury-box," thought Alice, "and those twelve creatures,"
3074 (she was obliged to say "creatures," you see, because some of them were
3075 animals, and some were birds,) "I suppose they are the jurors." She said
3076 this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of
3077 it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of her
3078 age knew the meaning of it at all. However, "jurymen" would have done
3079 just as well.
3080 
3081 The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. "What are they
3082 all doing?" Alice whispered to the Gryphon. "They can't have anything to
3083 put down yet, before the trial's begun."
3084 
3085 [Illustration: _Who stole the tarts?_]
3086 
3087 "They're putting down their names," the Gryphon whispered in reply,
3088 "for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial."
3089 
3090 "Stupid things!" Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped
3091 hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out "Silence in the court!" and the
3092 King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to see who was
3093 talking.
3094 
3095 Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,
3096 that all the jurors were writing down "stupid things!" on their slates,
3097 and she could even make out that one of them didn't know how to spell
3098 "stupid," and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. "A nice
3099 muddle their slates will be in before the trial's over!" thought Alice.
3100 
3101 One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This, of course, Alice
3102 could _not_ stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and
3103 very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly
3104 that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out
3105 at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he
3106 was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this
3107 was of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.
3108 
3109 "Herald, read the accusation!" said the King.
3110 
3111 On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then
3112 unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:
3113 
3114           "The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,
3115               All on a summer day:
3116           The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,
3117               And took them quite away!"
3118 
3119 "Consider your verdict," the King said to the jury.
3120 
3121 "Not yet, not yet!" the Rabbit hastily interrupted. "There's a great
3122 deal to come before that!"
3123 
3124 "Call the first witness," said the King; and the Rabbit blew three
3125 blasts on the trumpet, and called out "First witness!"
3126 
3127 The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand
3128 and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. "I beg pardon, your
3129 Majesty," he began, "for bringing these in; but I hadn't quite finished
3130 my tea when I was sent for."
3131 
3132 "You ought to have finished," said the King. "When did you begin?"
3133 
3134 The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the
3135 court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. "Fourteenth of March, I _think_ it
3136 was," he said.
3137 
3138 "Fifteenth," said the March Hare.
3139 
3140 "Sixteenth," said the Dormouse.
3141 
3142 "Write that down," the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly wrote
3143 down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and
3144 reduced the answer to shillings and pence.
3145 
3146 "Take off your hat," the King said to the Hatter.
3147 
3148 "It isn't mine," said the Hatter.
3149 
3150 "_Stolen!_" the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made
3151 a memorandum of the fact.
3152 
3153 "I keep them to sell," the Hatter added as an explanation: "I've none of
3154 my own. I'm a hatter."
3155 
3156 Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring hard at the
3157 Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted.
3158 
3159 "Give your evidence," said the King; "and don't be nervous, or I'll have
3160 you executed on the spot."
3161 
3162 This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting from
3163 one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his
3164 confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the
3165 bread-and-butter.
3166 
3167 Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled
3168 her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to
3169 grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave
3170 the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as
3171 long as there was room for her.
3172 
3173 "I wish you wouldn't squeeze so," said the Dormouse, who was sitting
3174 next to her. "I can hardly breathe."
3175 
3176 "I can't help it," said Alice very meekly: "I'm growing."
3177 
3178 "You've no right to grow _here_," said the Dormouse.
3179 
3180 "Don't talk nonsense," said Alice more boldly: "you know you're growing
3181 too."
3182 
3183 "Yes, but _I_ grow at a reasonable pace," said the Dormouse; "not in
3184 that ridiculous fashion." And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to
3185 the other side of the court.
3186 
3187 All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,
3188 just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers
3189 of the court, "Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!" on
3190 which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook off both his shoes.
3191 
3192 "Give your evidence," the King repeated angrily, "or I'll have you
3193 executed, whether you're nervous or not."
3194 
3195 "I'm a poor man, your Majesty," the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,
3196 "--and I hadn't begun my tea--not above a week or so--and what with the
3197 bread-and-butter getting so thin--and the twinkling of the tea----"
3198 
3199 "The twinkling of _what_?" said the King.
3200 
3201 "It _began_ with the tea," the Hatter replied.
3202 
3203 "Of course twinkling _begins_ with a T!" said the King sharply. "Do you
3204 take me for a dunce? Go on!"
3205 
3206 "I'm a poor man," the Hatter went on, "and most things twinkled after
3207 that--only the March Hare said----"
3208 
3209 "I didn't!" the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.
3210 
3211 "You did!" said the Hatter.
3212 
3213 "I deny it!" said the March Hare.
3214 
3215 "He denies it," said the King: "leave out that part."
3216 
3217 "Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said----" the Hatter went on, looking
3218 anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied
3219 nothing, being fast asleep.
3220 
3221 "After that," continued the Hatter, "I cut some more
3222 bread-and-butter----"
3223 
3224 "But what did the Dormouse say?" one of the jury asked.
3225 
3226 "That I can't remember," said the Hatter.
3227 
3228 "You _must_ remember," remarked the King, "or I'll have you executed."
3229 
3230 The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went
3231 down on one knee. "I'm a poor man, your Majesty," he began.
3232 
3233 "You're a _very_ poor _speaker_," said the King.
3234 
3235 Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by
3236 the officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just
3237 explain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied
3238 up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,
3239 head first, and then sat upon it.)
3240 
3241 "I'm glad I've seen that done," thought Alice. "I've so often read in
3242 the newspapers, at the end of trials, 'There was some attempt at
3243 applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the
3244 court,' and I never understood what it meant till now."
3245 
3246 "If that's all you know about it, you may stand down," continued the
3247 King.
3248 
3249 "I can't go no lower," said the Hatter: "I'm on the floor, as it is."
3250 
3251 "Then you may _sit_ down," the King replied.
3252 
3253 Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.
3254 
3255 "Come, that finishes the guinea-pigs!" thought Alice. "Now we shall get
3256 on better."
3257 
3258 "I'd rather finish my tea," said the Hatter, with an anxious look at
3259 the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.
3260 
3261 "You may go," said the King; and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,
3262 without even waiting to put his shoes on.
3263 
3264 "--and just take his head off outside," the Queen added to one of the
3265 officers; but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get
3266 to the door.
3267 
3268 "Call the next witness!" said the King.
3269 
3270 The next witness was the Duchess's cook. She carried the pepper-box in
3271 her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the
3272 court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.
3273 
3274 "Give your evidence," said the King.
3275 
3276 "Sha'n't," said the cook.
3277 
3278 The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice,
3279 "Your Majesty must cross-examine _this_ witness."
3280 
3281 "Well, if I must, I must," the King said with a melancholy air, and,
3282 after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were
3283 nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, "What are tarts made of?"
3284 
3285 "Pepper, mostly," said the cook.
3286 
3287 "Treacle," said a sleepy voice behind her.
3288 
3289 "Collar that Dormouse," the Queen shrieked out. "Behead that Dormouse!
3290 Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his
3291 whiskers."
3292 
3293 For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse
3294 turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had
3295 disappeared.
3296 
3297 [Illustration]
3298 
3299 "Never mind!" said the King, with an air of great relief. "Call the next
3300 witness." And he added in an undertone to the Queen, "Really, my dear,
3301 _you_ must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my forehead
3302 ache!"
3303 
3304 Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling very
3305 curious to see what the next witness would be like, "--for they haven't
3306 got much evidence _yet_," she said to herself. Imagine her surprise,
3307 when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill little voice,
3308 the name "Alice!"
3309 
3310 
3311 
3312 
3313 CHAPTER XII
3314 
3315 
3316 [Sidenote: _Alice's Evidence_]
3317 
3318 "HERE!" cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of
3319 the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she
3320 jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the
3321 edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the
3322 crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much
3323 of a globe of gold-fish she had accidentally upset the week before.
3324 
3325 "Oh, I _beg_ your pardon!" she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and
3326 began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident of
3327 the gold-fish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of idea
3328 that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box, or
3329 they would die.
3330 
3331 "The trial cannot proceed," said the King in a very grave voice, "until
3332 all the jurymen are back in their proper places--_all_," he repeated
3333 with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said so.
3334 
3335 Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put
3336 the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its
3337 tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon got
3338 it out again, and put it right; "not that it signifies much," she said
3339 to herself; "I should think it would be _quite_ as much use in the trial
3340 one way up as the other."
3341 
3342 As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being
3343 upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to
3344 them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the
3345 accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do
3346 anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the
3347 court.
3348 
3349 "What do you know about this business?" the King said to Alice.
3350 
3351 "Nothing," said Alice.
3352 
3353 "Nothing _whatever_?" persisted the King.
3354 
3355 "Nothing whatever," said Alice.
3356 
3357 "That's very important," the King said, turning to the jury. They were
3358 just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White Rabbit
3359 interrupted: "_Un_important, your Majesty means, of course," he said in
3360 a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as he
3361 spoke.
3362 
3363 "_Un_important, of course, I meant," the King hastily said, and went on
3364 himself in an undertone,"important--unimportant--unimportant--important----"
3365 as if he were trying which word sounded best.
3366 
3367 Some of the jury wrote it down "important," and some "unimportant."
3368 Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates;
3369 "but it doesn't matter a bit," she thought to herself.
3370 
3371 At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in
3372 his note-book, called out "Silence!" and read out from his book, "Rule
3373 Forty-two. _All persons more than a mile high to leave the court._"
3374 
3375 Everybody looked at Alice.
3376 
3377 "_I'm_ not a mile high," said Alice.
3378 
3379 "You are," said the King.
3380 
3381 "Nearly two miles high," added the Queen.
3382 
3383 "Well, I sha'n't go, at any rate," said Alice: "besides, that's not a
3384 regular rule: you invented it just now."
3385 
3386 "It's the oldest rule in the book," said the King.
3387 
3388 "Then it ought to be Number One," said Alice.
3389 
3390 The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. "Consider your
3391 verdict," he said to the jury, in a low trembling voice.
3392 
3393 "There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty," said the White
3394 Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry: "this paper has just been picked
3395 up."
3396 
3397 "What's in it?" said the Queen.
3398 
3399 "I haven't opened it yet," said the White Rabbit, "but it seems to be a
3400 letter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody."
3401 
3402 "It must have been that," said the King, "unless it was written to
3403 nobody, which isn't usual, you know."
3404 
3405 "Who is it directed to?" said one of the jurymen.
3406 
3407 "It isn't directed at all," said the White Rabbit; "in fact, there's
3408 nothing written on the _outside_." He unfolded the paper as he spoke,
3409 and added "It isn't a letter after all: it's a set of verses."
3410 
3411 "Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?" asked another of the jurymen.
3412 
3413 "No, they're not," said the White Rabbit, "and that's the queerest thing
3414 about it." (The jury all looked puzzled.)
3415 
3416 "He must have imitated somebody else's hand," said the King. (The jury
3417 all brightened up again.)
3418 
3419 "Please your Majesty," said the Knave, "I didn't write it, and they
3420 can't prove that I did: there's no name signed at the end."
3421 
3422 "If you didn't sign it," said the King, "that only makes the matter
3423 worse. You _must_ have meant some mischief, or else you'd have signed
3424 your name like an honest man."
3425 
3426 There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really
3427 clever thing the King had said that day.
3428 
3429 "That _proves_ his guilt, of course," said the Queen: "so, off with----"
3430 
3431 "It doesn't prove anything of the sort!" said Alice. "Why, you don't
3432 even know what they're about!"
3433 
3434 "Read them," said the King.
3435 
3436 The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. "Where shall I begin, please
3437 your Majesty?" he asked.
3438 
3439 "Begin at the beginning," the King said gravely, "and go on till you
3440 come to the end; then stop."
3441 
3442 There was dead silence in the court, whilst the White Rabbit read out
3443 these verses:--
3444 
3445           "They told me you had been to her,
3446              And mentioned me to him:
3447            She gave me a good character,
3448              But said I could not swim.
3449 
3450            He sent them word I had not gone,
3451              (We know it to be true):
3452            If she should push the matter on,
3453              What would become of you?
3454 
3455            I gave her one, they gave him two,
3456              You gave us three or more;
3457            They all returned from him to you,
3458              Though they were mine before.
3459 
3460            If I or she should chance to be
3461              Involved in this affair,
3462            He trusts to you to set them free,
3463              Exactly as we were.
3464 
3465            My notion was that you had been
3466              (Before she had this fit)
3467            An obstacle that came between
3468              Him, and ourselves, and it.
3469 
3470            Don't let him know she liked them best,
3471              For this must ever be
3472            A secret, kept from all the rest,
3473              Between yourself and me."
3474 
3475 "That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet," said the
3476 King, rubbing his hands; "so now let the jury----"
3477 
3478 "If any of them can explain it," said Alice, (she had grown so large in
3479 the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit afraid of interrupting him,)
3480 "I'll give him sixpence. _I_ don't believe there's an atom of meaning in
3481 it."
3482 
3483 The jury all wrote down on their slates, "_She_ doesn't believe there's
3484 an atom of meaning in it," but none of them attempted to explain the
3485 paper.
3486 
3487 "If there's no meaning in it," said the King, "that saves a world of
3488 trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. And yet I don't
3489 know," he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at
3490 them with one eye; "I seem to see some meaning in them after all.
3491 '----_said I could not swim_--' you can't swim can you?" he added,
3492 turning to the Knave.
3493 
3494 The Knave shook his head sadly. "Do I look like it?" he said. (Which he
3495 certainly did _not_, being made entirely of cardboard.)
3496 
3497 "All right, so far," said the King, as he went on muttering over the
3498 verses to himself: "'_We know it to be true_--' that's the jury, of
3499 course--'_If she should push the matter on_'--that must be the
3500 Queen--'_What would become of you?_'--What, indeed!--'_I gave her one,
3501 they gave him two_--' why, that must be what he did with the tarts, you
3502 know----"
3503 
3504 "But it goes on '_they all returned from him to you_,'" said Alice.
3505 
3506 "Why, there they are!" said the King triumphantly, pointing to the tarts
3507 on the table. "Nothing can be clearer than _that_. Then again--'_before
3508 she had this fit_--' you never had _fits_, my dear, I think?" he said to
3509 the Queen.
3510 
3511 "Never!" said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard
3512 as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his
3513 slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily
3514 began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as
3515 it lasted.)
3516 
3517 "Then the words don't _fit_ you," said the King, looking round the court
3518 with a smile. There was a dead silence.
3519 
3520 "It's a pun!" the King added in an angry tone, and everybody laughed.
3521 
3522 "Let the jury consider their verdict," the King said, for about the
3523 twentieth time that day.
3524 
3525 "No, no!" said the Queen. "Sentence first--verdict afterwards."
3526 
3527 "Stuff and nonsense!" said Alice loudly. "The idea of having the
3528 sentence first!"
3529 
3530 "Hold your tongue!" said the Queen, turning purple.
3531 
3532 "I won't!" said Alice.
3533 
3534 "Off with her head!" the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody
3535 moved.
3536 
3537 "Who cares for _you_?" said Alice (she had grown to her full size by
3538 this time). "You're nothing but a pack of cards!"
3539 
3540 [Illustration: _At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came
3541 flying down upon her_]
3542 
3543 At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon
3544 her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and
3545 tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her
3546 head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead
3547 leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.
3548 
3549 "Wake up, Alice dear!" said her sister. "Why, what a long sleep you've
3550 had!"
3551 
3552 "Oh, I've had such a curious dream!" said Alice, and she told her
3553 sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures
3554 of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she had
3555 finished, her sister kissed her, and said "It _was_ a curious dream,
3556 dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's getting late." So
3557 Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might,
3558 what a wonderful dream it had been.
3559 
3560 
3561 
3562 
3563 BUT her sister sat still just as she had left her, leaning her head,
3564 watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her
3565 wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and
3566 this was her dream:
3567 
3568 First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny
3569 hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking
3570 up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that
3571 queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that
3572 _would_ always get into her eyes--and still as she listened, or seemed
3573 to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the strange
3574 creatures of her little sister's dream.
3575 
3576 The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by--the
3577 frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool--she
3578 could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends
3579 shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen
3580 ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution--once more the pig-baby
3581 was sneezing on the Duchess' knee, while plates and dishes crashed
3582 around it--once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the
3583 Lizard's slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,
3584 filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock
3585 Turtle.
3586 
3587 So she sat on with closed eyes, and half believed herself in Wonderland,
3588 though she knew she had but to open them again, and all would change to
3589 dull reality--the grass would be only rustling in the wind, and the pool
3590 rippling to the waving of the reeds--the rattling teacups would change
3591 to the tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice
3592 of the shepherd boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the
3593 Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the
3594 confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the cattle
3595 in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's heavy sobs.
3596 
3597 Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers
3598 would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would
3599 keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her
3600 childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children,
3601 and make _their_ eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps
3602 even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel
3603 with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple
3604 joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.

3690 THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
3691 PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK
3692 
3693 To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
3694 distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
3695 (or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
3696 Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
3697 Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
3698 http://gutenberg.net/license).

3700 
3701 Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
3702 electronic works
3703 
3704 1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
3705 electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
3706 and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
3707 (trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
3708 the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
3709 all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
3710 If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
3711 Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
3712 terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
3713 entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
3714 
3715 1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
3716 used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
3717 agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
3718 things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
3719 even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
3720 paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
3721 Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
3722 and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
3723 works.  See paragraph 1.E below.
3724 
3725 1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
3726 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
3727 Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
3728 collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
3729 individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
3730 located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
3731 copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
3732 works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
3733 are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
3734 Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
3735 freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
3736 this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
3737 the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
3738 keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
3739 Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.
3740 
3741 1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
3742 what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
3743 a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
3744 the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
3745 before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
3746 creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
3747 Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
3748 the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
3749 States.
3750 
3751 1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
3752 
3753 1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
3754 access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
3755 whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
3756 phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
3757 Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
3758 copied or distributed:
3759 
3760 This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
3761 almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
3762 re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
3763 with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net
3764 
3765 1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
3766 from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
3767 posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
3768 and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
3769 or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
3770 with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
3771 work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
3772 through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
3773 Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
3774 1.E.9.
3775 
3776 1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
3777 with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
3778 must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
3779 terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
3780 to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
3781 permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.
3782 
3783 1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
3784 License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
3785 work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.
3786 
3787 1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
3788 electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
3789 prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
3790 active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
3791 Gutenberg-tm License.
3792 
3793 1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
3794 compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
3795 word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
3796 distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
3797 "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
3798 posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
3799 you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
3800 copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
3801 request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
3802 form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
3803 License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
3804 
3805 1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
3806 performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
3807 unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
3808 
3809 1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
3810 access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
3811 that
3812 
3813 - You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
3814      the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
3815      you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
3816      owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
3817      has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
3818      Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
3819      must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
3820      prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
3821      returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
3822      sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
3823      address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
3824      the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."
3825 
3826 - You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
3827      you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
3828      does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
3829      License.  You must require such a user to return or
3830      destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
3831      and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
3832      Project Gutenberg-tm works.
3833 
3834 - You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
3835      money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
3836      electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
3837      of receipt of the work.
3838 
3839 - You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
3840      distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.
3841 
3842 1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
3843 electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
3844 forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
3845 both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
3846 Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
3847 Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.
3848 
3849 1.F.
3850 
3851 1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
3852 effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
3853 public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
3854 collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
3855 works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
3856 "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
3857 corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
3858 property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
3859 computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
3860 your equipment.
3861 
3862 1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
3863 of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
3864 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
3865 Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
3866 Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
3867 liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
3868 fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
3869 LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
3870 PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
3871 TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
3872 LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
3873 INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
3874 DAMAGE.
3875 
3876 1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
3877 defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
3878 receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
3879 written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
3880 received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
3881 your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
3882 the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
3883 refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
3884 providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
3885 receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
3886 is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
3887 opportunities to fix the problem.
3888 
3889 1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
3890 in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
3891 WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
3892 WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
3893 
3894 1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
3895 warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
3896 If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
3897 law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
3898 interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
3899 the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
3900 provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.
3901 
3902 1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
3903 trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
3904 providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
3905 with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
3906 promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
3907 harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
3908 that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
3909 or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
3910 work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
3911 Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.
3912 
3913 
3914 Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
3915 
3916 Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
3917 electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
3918 including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
3919 because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
3920 people in all walks of life.
3921 
3922 Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
3923 assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
3924 goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
3925 remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
3926 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
3927 and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
3928 To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
3929 and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

3933 Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
3934 Foundation
3935 
3936 The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
3937 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
3938 state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
3939 Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
3940 number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

3959 Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
3960 Literary Archive Foundation
3961 
3962 Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
3963 spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
3964 increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
3965 freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
3966 array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
3967 ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
3968 status with the IRS.
3969 
3970 The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
3971 charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
3972 States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
3973 considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
3974 with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
3975 where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
3976 SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
3977 particular state visit http://pglaf.org
3978 
3979 While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
3980 have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
3981 against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
3982 approach us with offers to donate.
3983 
3984 International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
3985 any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
3986 outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
3987 
3988 Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
3989 methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
3990 ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
3991 donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate

3993 
3994 Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
3995 works.
3996 
3997 Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
3998 concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
3999 with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
4000 Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
4001 
4002 
4003 Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
4004 editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
4005 unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
4006 keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
